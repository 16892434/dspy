They included the award-winning novels \"Ragtime\" (1975), \"Billy Bathgate\" (1989), and \"The March\" (2005).

There are reports of the two princes being seen playing in the Tower grounds shortly after Richard joined his brother, but there are no recorded sightings of either of them after the summer of 1483.

Many historians believe the princes were murdered, some suggesting that the act may have happened towards the end of summer 1483. Maurice Keen argues that the rebellion against Richard in 1483 initially \"aimed to rescue Edward V and', \"Princes in the Tower | among others. It has also been suggested that one or both princes may have escaped assassination.
