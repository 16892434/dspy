In an April 2011 prison interview with \"Newsday\", Rifkin denied having anything to do with the remains discovered in 2011. Experts and victims\\' rights advocates, however, believe that those denials have no value. Rifkin\\'s birth mother was a 20-year-old college student, and his biological father was a 24-year-old college student and army veteran. At three weeks old he was adopted by an upper-middle class Long Island couple, on February 14, 1959.
