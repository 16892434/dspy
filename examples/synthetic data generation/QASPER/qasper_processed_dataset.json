  "question": "What is the seed lexicon?",
  "answer": "a vocabulary of positive and negative predicates that helps determine the polarity score of an event",
  "evidence": "Proposed Method ::: Discourse Relation-Based Event Pairs\n-----\nThe seed lexicon consists of positive and negative predicates. If the predicate of an extracted event is in the seed lexicon and does not involve complex phenomena like negation, we assign the corresponding polarity score ($+1$ for positive events and $-1$ for negative events) to the event. We expect the model to automatically learn complex phenomena through label propagation. Based on the availability of scores and the types of discourse relations, we classify the extracted event pairs into the following three types.\n\n",

If the seed lexicon suggests $x_2$ is positive, $x_1$ is also likely to be positive because it triggers the positive emotion. The fact that $x_2$ is known to be negative indicates the negative polarity of $x_1$. Similarly, if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in the discourse relation of Concession (i.e., $x_2$ in spite of $x_1$), the reverse of $x_2$'s polarity can be propagated to $x_1$. Even if $x_2$'s polarity is not known in advance, we can exploit the tendency of $x_1$ and $x_2$ to be of the same polarity (for Cause) or of the reverse polarity (for Concession) although the heuristic is not exempt from counterexamples.

  "evidence": "Experiments ::: Dataset ::: AL, CA, and CO\n-----\nAs a raw corpus, we used a Japanese web corpus that was compiled through the procedures proposed by BIBREF13. To extract event pairs tagged with discourse relations, we used the Japanese dependency parser KNP and in-house postprocessing scripts BIBREF14. KNP used hand-written rules to segment each sentence into what we conventionally called clauses (mostly consecutive text chunks), each of which contained one main predicate. KNP also identified the discourse relations of event pairs if explicit discourse connectives BIBREF4 such as \u201c\u306e\u3067\u201d (because) and \u201c\u306e\u306b\u201d (in spite of) were present. We treated Cause/Reason (\u539f\u56e0\u30fb\u7406\u7531) and Condition (\u6761\u4ef6) in the original tagset BIBREF15 as Cause and Concession (\u9006\u63a5) as Concession, respectively. Here is an example of event pair extraction.\n\nExperiments ::: Dataset ::: AL, CA, and CO\n-----\nWe constructed our seed lexicon consisting of 15 positive words and 15 negative words, as shown in Section SECREF27. From the corpus of about 100 million sentences, we obtained 1.4 millions event pairs for AL, 41 millions for CA, and 6 millions for CO. We randomly selected subsets of AL event pairs such that positive and negative latter events were equal in size. We also sampled event pairs for each of CA and CO such that it was five times larger than AL. The results are shown in Table TABREF16.\n\nExperiments ::: Dataset ::: ACP (ACP Corpus)\n-----\nWe used the latest version of the ACP Corpus BIBREF12 for evaluation. It was used for (semi-)supervised training as well. Extracted from Japanese websites using HTML layouts and linguistic patterns, the dataset covered various genres. For example, the following two sentences were labeled positive and negative, respectively:\n\nExperiments ::: Dataset ::: ACP (ACP Corpus)\n-----\nAlthough the ACP corpus was originally constructed in the context of sentiment analysis, we found that it could roughly be regarded as a collection of affective events.

  "abstract": "A community's identity defines and shapes its internal dynamics. Our current understanding of this interplay is mostly limited to glimpses gathered from isolated studies of individual communities. In this work we provide a systematic exploration of the nature of this relation across a wide variety of online communities. To this end we introduce a quantitative, language-based typology reflecting two key aspects of a community's identity: how distinctive, and how temporally dynamic it is. By mapping almost 300 Reddit communities into the landscape induced by this typology, we reveal regularities in how patterns of user engagement vary with the characteristics of a community. Our results suggest that the way new and existing users engage with a community depends strongly and systematically on the nature of the collective identity it fosters, in ways that are highly consequential to community maintainers. For example, communities with distinctive and highly dynamic identities are more likely to retain their users. However, such niche communities also exhibit much larger acculturation gaps between existing users and newcomers, which potentially hinder the integration of the latter. More generally, our methodology reveals differences in how various social phenomena manifest across communities, and shows that structuring the multi-community landscape can lead to a better understanding of the systematic nature of this diversity.",
  "question": "How do the various social phenomena examined manifest in different types of communities?",
  "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n",
  "evidence": "Community-type and monthly retention\n-----\nWe find that dynamic communities, such as Seahawks or starcraft, have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities (Spearman's INLINEFORM0 = 0.70, INLINEFORM1 0.001, computed with community points averaged over months; Figure FIGREF11 .A, left). Similarly, more distinctive communities, like Cooking and Naruto, exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities (Spearman's INLINEFORM2 = 0.33, INLINEFORM3 0.001; Figure FIGREF11 .A, right).\n\nCommunity-type and user tenure\n-----\nAs with monthly retention, we find a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community (Spearman's INLINEFORM0 = 0.41, INLINEFORM1 0.001, computed over all community points; Figure FIGREF11 .B, left). This verifies that the short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content. Interestingly, there is no significant relationship between distinctiveness and long-term engagement (Spearman's INLINEFORM2 = 0.03, INLINEFORM3 0.77; Figure FIGREF11 .B, right).

  "abstract": "In recent years, we have witnessed a dramatic shift towards techniques driven by neural networks for a variety of NLP tasks. Undoubtedly, neural language models (NLMs) have reduced perplexity by impressive amounts. This progress, however, comes at a substantial cost in performance, in terms of inference latency and energy consumption, which is particularly of concern in deployments on mobile devices. This paper, which examines the quality-performance tradeoff of various language modeling techniques, represents to our knowledge the first to make this observation. We compare state-of-the-art NLMs with\"classic\"Kneser-Ney (KN) LMs in terms of energy usage, latency, perplexity, and prediction accuracy using two standard benchmarks. On a Raspberry Pi, we find that orders of increase in latency and energy usage correspond to less change in perplexity, while the difference is much less pronounced on a desktop.",

  "title": "Probabilistic Bias Mitigation in Word Embeddings",
  "abstract": "It has been shown that word embeddings derived from large corpora tend to incorporate biases present in their training data. Various methods for mitigating these biases have been proposed, but recent work has demonstrated that these methods hide but fail to truly remove the biases, which can still be observed in word nearest-neighbor statistics. In this work we propose a probabilistic view of word embedding bias. We leverage this framework to present a novel method for mitigating bias which relies on probabilistic observations to yield a more robust bias mitigation algorithm. We demonstrate that this method effectively reduces bias according to three separate measures of bias while maintaining embedding quality across various popular benchmark semantic tasks",
  "question": "What are the three measures of bias which are reduced in experiments?",
  "answer": "RIPA, Neighborhood Metric, WEAT",
  "evidence": "Background ::: Geometric Bias Mitigation\n-----\nGeometric bias mitigation uses the cosine distances between words to both measure and remove gender bias BIBREF0. This method implicitly defines bias as a geometric asymmetry between words when projected onto a subspace, such as the gender subspace constructed from a set of gender pairs such as $\\mathcal {P} = \\lbrace (he,she),(man,woman),(king,queen)...\\rbrace $. The projection of a vector $v$ onto $B$ (the subspace) is defined by $v_B = \\sum _{j=1}^{k} (v \\cdot b_j) b_j$ where a subspace $B$ is defined by k orthogonal unit vectors $B = {b_1,...,b_k}$.\n\nBackground ::: Geometric Bias Mitigation ::: WEAT\n-----\nThe WEAT statistic BIBREF1 demonstrates the presence of biases in word embeddings with an effect size defined as the mean test statistic across the two word sets:\n\nBackground ::: Geometric Bias Mitigation ::: WEAT\n-----\nWhere $s$, the test statistic, is defined as: $s(w,A,B) = mean_{a \\in A} cos(w,a) - mean_{b \\in B} cos(w,a)$, and $X$,$Y$,$A$, and $B$ are groups of words for which the association is measured. Possible values range from $-2$ to 2 depending on the association of the words groups, and a value of zero indicates $X$ and $Y$ are equally associated with $A$ and $B$. See BIBREF4 for further details on WEAT.\n\nBackground ::: Geometric Bias Mitigation ::: RIPA\n-----\nThe RIPA (relational inner product association) metric was developed as an alternative to WEAT, with the critique that WEAT is likely to overestimate the bias of a target attribute BIBREF4. The RIPA metric formalizes the measure of bias used in geometric bias mitigation as the inner product association of a word vector $v$ with respect to a relation vector $b$. The relation vector is constructed from the first principal component of the differences between gender word pairs. We report the absolute value of the RIPA metric as the value can be positive or negative according to the direction of the bias. A value of zero indicates a lack of bias, and the value is bound by $[-||w||,||w||]$.\n\nBackground ::: Geometric Bias Mitigation ::: Neighborhood Metric\n-----\nThe neighborhood bias metric proposed by BIBREF5 quantifies bias as the proportion of male socially-biased words among the $k$ nearest socially-biased male and female neighboring words, whereby biased words are obtained by projecting neutral words onto a gender relation vector. As we only examine the target word among the 1000 most socially-biased words in the vocabulary (500 male and 500 female), a word\u2019s bias is measured as the ratio of its neighborhood of socially-biased male and socially-biased female words, so that a value of 0.5 in this metric would indicate a perfectly unbiased word, and values closer to 0 and 1 indicate stronger bias.\n\n",

  "abstract": "Veteran mental health is a significant national problem as large number of veterans are returning from the recent war in Iraq and continued military presence in Afghanistan. While significant existing works have investigated twitter posts-based Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) assessment using blackbox machine learning techniques, these frameworks cannot be trusted by the clinicians due to the lack of clinical explainability. To obtain the trust of clinicians, we explore the big question, can twitter posts provide enough information to fill up clinical PTSD assessment surveys that have been traditionally trusted by clinicians? To answer the above question, we propose, LAXARY (Linguistic Analysis-based Exaplainable Inquiry) model, a novel Explainable Artificial Intelligent (XAI) model to detect and represent PTSD assessment of twitter users using a modified Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) analysis. First, we employ clinically validated survey tools for collecting clinical PTSD assessment data from real twitter users and develop a PTSD Linguistic Dictionary using the PTSD assessment survey results. Then, we use the PTSD Linguistic Dictionary along with machine learning model to fill up the survey tools towards detecting PTSD status and its intensity of corresponding twitter users. Our experimental evaluation on 210 clinically validated veteran twitter users provides promising accuracies of both PTSD classification and its intensity estimation.

The distribution of this training-test dataset segmentation followed a 50% distribution of PTSD and No PTSD from the original dataset. Our final survey based classification results showed an accuracy of 96% in detecting PTSD and mean squared error of 1.2 in estimating its intensity given we have four intensity, No PTSD, Low Risk PTSD, Moderate Risk PTSD and High Risk PTSD with a score of 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Table TABREF29 shows the classification details of our experiment which provide the very good accuracy of our classification. To compare the outperformance of our method, we also implemented Coppersmith et. al. proposed method and achieved an 86% overall accuracy of detecting PTSD users BIBREF11 following the same training-test dataset distribution. Fig FIGREF28 illustrates the comparisons between LAXARY and Coppersmith et. al. proposed method. Here we can see, the outperformance of our proposed method as well as the importance of $s-score$ estimation. We also illustrates the importance of $\\alpha -score$ and $S-score$ in Fig FIGREF30. Fig FIGREF30 illustrates that if we change the number of training samples (%), LAXARY models outperforms Coppersmith et. al. proposed model under any condition. In terms of intensity, Coppersmith et. al. totally fails to provide any idea however LAXARY provides extremely accurate measures of intensity estimation for PTSD sufferers (as shown in Fig FIGREF31) which can be explained simply providing LAXARY model filled out survey details. Table TABREF29 shows the details of accuracies of both PTSD detection and intensity estimation. Fig FIGREF32 shows the classification accuracy changes over the training sample sizes for each survey which shows that DOSPERT scale outperform other surveys. Fig FIGREF33 shows that if we take previous weeks (instead of only the week diagnosis of PTSD was taken), there are no significant patterns of PTSD detection.\n\n",

  "abstract": "Language Identification (LI) is an important first step in several speech processing systems. With a growing number of voice-based assistants, speech LI has emerged as a widely researched field. To approach the problem of identifying languages, we can either adopt an implicit approach where only the speech for a language is present or an explicit one where text is available with its corresponding transcript. This paper focuses on an implicit approach due to the absence of transcriptive data. This paper benchmarks existing models and proposes a new attention based model for language identification which uses log-Mel spectrogram images as input. We also present the effectiveness of raw waveforms as features to neural network models for LI tasks. For training and evaluation of models, we classified six languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Russian and Italian) with an accuracy of 95.4% and four languages (English, French, German, Spanish) with an accuracy of 96.3% obtained from the VoxForge dataset.

In this work, we perform comprehensive experiments for detecting subjective bias using BERT-based models on the Wiki Neutrality Corpus(WNC). The dataset consists of $360k$ labeled instances, from Wikipedia edits that remove various instances of the bias. We further propose BERT-based ensembles that outperform state-of-the-art methods like $BERT_{large}$ by a margin of $5.6$ F1 score.",

Writers and editors of texts like news and textbooks try to avoid the use of biased language, yet subjective bias is pervasive in these texts. More than $56\\%$ of Americans believe that news sources do not report the news objectively , thus implying the prevalence of the bias. Therefore, when presenting factual information, it becomes necessary to differentiate subjective language from objective language.\n\nIntroduction\n-----\nIn this work, we investigate the application of BERT-based models for the task of subjective language detection. We explore various BERT-based models, including BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, with their base and large specifications along with their native classifiers.

  "abstract": "Article comments can provide supplementary opinions and facts for readers, thereby increase the attraction and engagement of articles. Therefore, automatically commenting is helpful in improving the activeness of the community, such as online forums and news websites. Previous work shows that training an automatic commenting system requires large parallel corpora. Although part of articles are naturally paired with the comments on some websites, most articles and comments are unpaired on the Internet. To fully exploit the unpaired data, we completely remove the need for parallel data and propose a novel unsupervised approach to train an automatic article commenting model, relying on nothing but unpaired articles and comments. Our model is based on a retrieval-based commenting framework, which uses news to retrieve comments based on the similarity of their topics. The topic representation is obtained from a neural variational topic model, which is trained in an unsupervised manner. We evaluate our model on a news comment dataset. Experiments show that our proposed topic-based approach significantly outperforms previous lexicon-based models. The model also profits from paired corpora and achieves state-of-the-art performance under semi-supervised scenarios.",

We first compare our proposed model with other popular unsupervised methods, including TF-IDF, LDA, and NVDM. TF-IDF retrieves the comments by similarity of words rather than the semantic meaning, so it achieves low scores on all the retrieval metrics. The neural variational document model is based on the neural VAE framework. It can capture the semantic information, so it has better performance than the TF-IDF model. LDA models the topic information, and captures the deeper relationship between the article and comments, so it achieves improvement in all relevance metrics. Finally, our proposed model outperforms all these unsupervised methods, mainly because the proposed model learns both the semantics and the topic information.\n\nGenerative Evaluation\n-----\nTable TABREF32 shows the performance for our models and the baselines in generative evaluation.

Highly frequent words in a given topic that do not appear very often in other topics are viewed as making that topic exclusive. Cohesive and exclusive topics are more semantically useful. Following BIBREF8 we generate a set of candidate models ranging between 3 and 50 topics.

Contrary to most of the previous work, in this study, we do not rely on strong inductive bias and explore the question of how multimodality can be exploited to provide a complementary semantic signal. Towards this end, we introduce a new entity-aware neural comprehension model augmented with external relational memory units. Our model learns to dynamically update entity states in relation to each other while reading the text instructions. Our experimental analysis on the visual reasoning tasks in the recently proposed RecipeQA dataset reveals that our approach improves the accuracy of the previously reported models by a large margin.

In multi-task training setting where a single model is trained to solve all the tasks at once, PRN and BIDAF w/ static memory perform comparably and give much better results than BIDAF. Note that the model performances in the multi-task training setting are worse than single-task performances.

In this paper, we present an active learning method for CWS in medical text. To effectively utilize complete segmentation history, a new scoring model in sampling strategy is proposed, which combines information entropy with neural network. Besides, to capture interactions between adjacent characters, K-means clustering features are additionally added in word segmenter.

  "abstract": "Pretraining deep contextualized representations using an unsupervised language modeling objective has led to large performance gains for a variety of NLP tasks. Despite this success, recent work by Schick and Schutze (2019) suggests that these architectures struggle to understand rare words. For context-independent word embeddings, this problem can be addressed by separately learning representations for infrequent words. In this work, we show that the same idea can also be applied to contextualized models and clearly improves their downstream task performance. Most approaches for inducing word embeddings into existing embedding spaces are based on simple bag-of-words models; hence they are not a suitable counterpart for deep neural network language models. To overcome this problem, we introduce BERTRAM, a powerful architecture based on a pretrained BERT language model and capable of inferring high-quality representations for rare words. In BERTRAM, surface form and contexts of a word directly interact with each other in a deep architecture. Both on a rare word probing task and on three downstream task datasets, BERTRAM considerably improves representations for rare and medium frequency words compared to both a standalone BERT model and previous work.",

Moreover, the add and add-gated variants of Bertram perform surprisingly well for more frequent words, improving the score for WNLaMPro-medium by 50% compared to BERT$_\\text{base}$ and 31% compared to Attentive Mimicking. This makes sense considering that compared to Attentive Mimicking, the key enhancement of Bertram lies in improving context representations and interconnection of form and context; naturally, the more contexts are given, the more this comes into play. Noticeably, despite being both based on and integrated into a BERT$_\\text{base}$ model, our architecture even outperforms a standalone BERT$_\\text{large}$ model by a large margin.\n\n"

We describe an in-car experiment for emotion recognition from speech interactions for three modalities: the audio signal of a spoken interaction, the visual signal of the driver's face, and the manually transcribed content of utterances of the driver. We use off-the-shelf tools for emotion detection in audio and face and compare that to a neural transfer learning approach for emotion recognition from text which utilizes existing resources from other domains. We see that transfer learning enables models based on out-of-domain corpora to perform well. This method contributes up to 10 percentage points in F1, with up to 76 micro-average F1 across the emotions joy, annoyance and insecurity. Our findings also indicate that off-the-shelf-tools analyzing face and audio are not ready yet for emotion detection in in-car speech interactions without further adjustments.",
  "question": "What is the baseline method for the task?",
  "answer": "For the emotion recognition from text they use described neural network as baseline.\nFor audio and face there is no baseline.",

To exploit existing and available data sets which are larger than the AMMER data set, we develop a transfer learning approach. We use a neural network with an embedding layer (frozen weights, pre-trained on Common Crawl and Wikipedia BIBREF36), a bidirectional LSTM BIBREF37, and two dense layers followed by a soft max output layer. This setup is inspired by BIBREF38. We use a dropout rate of 0.3 in all layers and optimize with Adam BIBREF39 with a learning rate of $10^{-5}$ (These parameters are the same for all further experiments). We build on top of the Keras library with the TensorFlow backend. We consider this setup our baseline model.\n\n"

  "abstract": "It has been shown that the performance of neural machine translation (NMT) drops starkly in low-resource conditions, underperforming phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) and requiring large amounts of auxiliary data to achieve competitive results. In this paper, we re-assess the validity of these results, arguing that they are the result of lack of system adaptation to low-resource settings. We discuss some pitfalls to be aware of when training low-resource NMT systems, and recent techniques that have shown to be especially helpful in low-resource settings, resulting in a set of best practices for low-resource NMT. In our experiments on German--English with different amounts of IWSLT14 training data, we show that, without the use of any auxiliary monolingual or multilingual data, an optimized NMT system can outperform PBSMT with far less data than previously claimed.

From assembly language to present day\u2019s object-oriented programming, concepts came to make programming easier so that a programmer can focus on the logic and the architecture rather than the code and language itself. To go a step further in this journey of removing human-computer language barrier, this paper proposes machine learning approach using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) to convert human language into programming language code. The programmer will write expressions for codes in layman\u2019s language, and the machine learning model will translate it to the targeted programming language.

  "abstract": "Text-to-image synthesis refers to computational methods which translate human written textual descriptions, in the form of keywords or sentences, into images with similar semantic meaning to the text. In earlier research, image synthesis relied mainly on word to image correlation analysis combined with supervised methods to find best alignment of the visual content matching to the text. Recent progress in deep learning (DL) has brought a new set of unsupervised deep learning methods, particularly deep generative models which are able to generate realistic visual images using suitably trained neural network models. In this paper, we review the most recent development in the text-to-image synthesis research domain. Our survey first introduces image synthesis and its challenges, and then reviews key concepts such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and deep convolutional encoder-decoder neural networks (DCNN). After that, we propose a taxonomy to summarize GAN based text-to-image synthesis into four major categories: Semantic Enhancement GANs, Resolution Enhancement GANs, Diversity Enhancement GANS, and Motion Enhancement GANs. We elaborate the main objective of each group, and further review typical GAN architectures in each group. The taxonomy and the review outline the techniques and the evolution of different approaches, and eventually provide a clear roadmap to summarize the list of contemporaneous solutions that utilize GANs and DCNNs to generate enthralling results in categories such as human faces, birds, flowers, room interiors, object reconstruction from edge maps (games) etc. The survey will conclude with a comparison of the proposed solutions, challenges that remain unresolved, and future developments in the text-to-image synthesis domain.",

  "title": "Learning High-order Structural and Attribute information by Knowledge Graph Attention Networks for Enhancing Knowledge Graph Embedding",
  "abstract": "The goal of representation learning of knowledge graph is to encode both entities and relations into a low-dimensional embedding spaces. Many recent works have demonstrated the benefits of knowledge graph embedding on knowledge graph completion task, such as relation extraction. However, we observe that: 1) existing method just take direct relations between entities into consideration and fails to express high-order structural relationship between entities; 2) these methods just leverage relation triples of KGs while ignoring a large number of attribute triples that encoding rich semantic information. To overcome these limitations, this paper propose a novel knowledge graph embedding method, named KANE, which is inspired by the recent developments of graph convolutional networks (GCN). KANE can capture both high-order structural and attribute information of KGs in an efficient, explicit and unified manner under the graph convolutional networks framework. Empirical results on three datasets show that KANE significantly outperforms seven state-of-arts methods. Further analysis verify the efficiency of our method and the benefits brought by the attention mechanism.",

The results is clearly demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-art results on accuracy for three datasets. For more in-depth performance analysis, we note: (1) Among all baselines, Path-based methods and Attribute-incorporated methods outperform three typical methods. This indicates that incorporating extra information can improve the knowledge graph embedding performance; (2) Four variants of KANE always outperform baseline methods. The main reasons why KANE works well are two fold: 1) KANE can capture high-order structural information of KGs in an efficient, explicit manner and passe these information to their neighboring; 2) KANE leverages rich information encoded in attribute triples. These rich semantic information can further improve the performance of knowledge graph; (3) The variant of KANE that use LSTM Encoder and Concatenation aggregator outperform other variants. The main reasons is that LSTM encoder can distinguish the word order and concatenation aggregator combine all embedding of multi-head attention in a higher leaver feature space, which can obtain sufficient expressive power.\n\n"

  "abstract": "We present two new large-scale datasets aimed at evaluating systems designed to comprehend a natural language query and extract its answer from a large corpus of text. The Quasar-S dataset consists of 37000 cloze-style (fill-in-the-gap) queries constructed from definitions of software entity tags on the popular website Stack Overflow. The posts and comments on the website serve as the background corpus for answering the cloze questions. The Quasar-T dataset consists of 43000 open-domain trivia questions and their answers obtained from various internet sources. ClueWeb09 serves as the background corpus for extracting these answers. We pose these datasets as a challenge for two related subtasks of factoid Question Answering: (1) searching for relevant pieces of text that include the correct answer to a query, and (2) reading the retrieved text to answer the query. We also describe a retrieval system for extracting relevant sentences and documents from the corpus given a query, and include these in the release for researchers wishing to only focus on (2). We evaluate several baselines on both datasets, ranging from simple heuristics to powerful neural models, and show that these lag behind human performance by 16.4% and 32.1% for Quasar-S and -T respectively.

For these, we refer to the fraction of instances for which the correct answer is present in the context as Search Accuracy. The performance of the baseline among these instances is referred to as the Reading Accuracy, and the overall performance (which is a product of the two) is referred to as the Overall Accuracy. In Figure 4 we compare how these three vary as the number of context documents is varied. Naturally, the search accuracy increases as the context size increases, however at the same time reading performance decreases since the task of extracting the answer becomes harder for longer documents. Hence, simply retrieving more documents is not sufficient \u2013 finding the few most relevant ones will allow the reader to work best.\n\n"

One might think that classic retrieval models like language models for information retrieval BIBREF0 could solve these tasks. However, a big challenge for cQA tasks is that users are used to expressing similar meanings with different words, which creates gaps when matching questions based on common words. Other challenges include informal usage of language, highly diverse content of comments, and variation in the length of both questions and comments.\n\nPredicting Relationships of Object Pairs with an Attention Model\n-----\nIn our cQA tasks, the pair of objects are (question, question) or (question, comment), and the relationship is relevant/irrelevant. The left side of Figure 1 shows one intuitive way to predict relationships using RNNs. Parallel LSTMs encode two objects independently, and then concatenate their outputs as an input to a feed-forward neural network (FNN) with a softmax output layer for classification.\n\nModeling Question-External Comments\n-----\nFor task C, in addition to an original question (oriQ) and an external comment (relC), the question which relC commented on is also given (relQ).

Specifically, we \"occlude\" the majority of a document's text and add context-sensitive commands that reveal \"glimpses\" of the hidden text to a model.

When there exist multiple ground-truth answers, we report the max $\\text{F}_1$ score. Second, mastering multiple games remains quite challenging for RL agents.

  "title": "CamemBERT: a Tasty French Language Model",
  "abstract": "Pretrained language models are now ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing. Despite their success, most available models have either been trained on English data or on the concatenation of data in multiple languages. This makes practical use of such models\u2014in all languages except English\u2014very limited. Aiming to address this issue for French, we release CamemBERT, a French version of the Bi-directional Encoders for Transformers (BERT). We measure the performance of CamemBERT compared to multilingual models in multiple downstream tasks, namely part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named-entity recognition, and natural language inference. CamemBERT improves the state of the art for most of the tasks considered. We release the pretrained model for CamemBERT hoping to foster research and downstream applications for French NLP.",
  "question": "What is the state of the art?",
  "answer": "POS and DP task: CONLL 2018\nNER task: (no extensive work) Strong baselines CRF and BiLSTM-CRF\nNLI task: mBERT or XLM (not clear from text)",

  "title": "Semantic Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data",
  "abstract": "Internet and the proliferation of smart mobile devices have changed the way information is created, shared, and spreads, e.g., microblogs such as Twitter, weblogs such as LiveJournal, social networks such as Facebook, and instant messengers such as Skype and WhatsApp are now commonly used to share thoughts and opinions about anything in the surrounding world. This has resulted in the proliferation of social media content, thus creating new opportunities to study public opinion at a scale that was never possible before. Naturally, this abundance of data has quickly attracted business and research interest from various fields including marketing, political science, and social studies, among many others, which are interested in questions like these: Do people like the new Apple Watch? Do Americans support ObamaCare? How do Scottish feel about the Brexit? Answering these questions requires studying the sentiment of opinions people express in social media, which has given rise to the fast growth of the field of sentiment analysis in social media, with Twitter being especially popular for research due to its scale, representativeness, variety of topics discussed, as well as ease of public access to its messages. Here we present an overview of work on sentiment analysis on Twitter.",
  "question": "What difficulties does sentiment analysis on Twitter have, compared to sentiment analysis in other domains?",
  "answer": "Tweets noisy nature, use of creative spelling and punctuation, misspellings, slang, new words, URLs, and genre-specific terminology and abbreviations, short (length limited) text",
  "evidence": "Features and Learning\n-----\nPre-processing. Tweets are subject to standard preprocessing steps for text such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop-word removal, and part-of-speech tagging. Moreover, due to their noisy nature, they are also processed using some Twitter-specific techniques such as substitution/removal of URLs, of user mentions, of hashtags, and of emoticons, spelling correction, elongation normalization, abbreviation lookup, punctuation removal, detection of amplifiers and diminishers, negation scope detection, etc. For this, one typically uses Twitter-specific NLP tools such as part-of-speech and named entity taggers, syntactic parsers, etc. BIBREF47 , BIBREF48 , BIBREF49 .\n\nIntroduction\n-----\nDespite all these opportunities, the rise of social media has also presented new challenges for natural language processing (NLP) applications, which had largely relied on NLP tools tuned for formal text genres such as newswire, and thus were not readily applicable to the informal language and style of social media. That language proved to be quite challenging with its use of creative spelling and punctuation, misspellings, slang, new words, URLs, and genre-specific terminology and abbreviations, e.g., RT for re-tweet and #hashtags. In addition to the genre difference, there is also a difference in length: social media messages are generally short, often length-limited by design as in Twitter, i.e., a sentence or a headline rather than a full document. How to handle such challenges has only recently been the subject of thorough research BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 .\n\n"

  "title": "A Deep Neural Architecture for Sentence-level Sentiment Classification in Twitter Social Networking",
  "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework including a lexicon-based approach for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label distribution. We propose to first apply semantic rules and then use a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DeepCNN) for character-level embeddings in order to increase information for word-level embedding. After that, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM) produces a sentence-wide feature representation from the word-level embedding. We evaluate our approach on three Twitter sentiment classification datasets. Experimental results show that our model can improve the classification accuracy of sentence-level sentiment analysis in Twitter social networking.",
  "question": "What semantic rules are proposed?",
  "answer": "rules that compute polarity of words after POS tagging or parsing steps",
  "evidence": "Semantic Rules (SR)\n-----\nIn Twitter social networking, people express their opinions containing sub-sentences. These sub-sentences using specific PoS particles (Conjunction and Conjunctive adverbs), like \"but, while, however, despite, however\" have different polarities. However, the overall sentiment of tweets often focus on certain sub-sentences. For example:\n\nSemantic Rules (SR)\n-----\n@lonedog bwahahah...you are amazing! However, it was quite the letdown.\n\nSemantic Rules (SR)\n-----\n@kirstiealley my dentist is great but she's expensive...=(\n\nSemantic Rules (SR)\n-----\nIn two tweets above, the overall sentiment is negative. However, the main sentiment is only in the sub-sentences following but and however. This inspires a processing step to remove unessential parts in a tweet. Rule-based approach can assists these problems in handling negation and dealing with specific PoS particles led to effectively affect the final output of classification BIBREF11 BIBREF16 . BIBREF11 summarized a full presentation of their semantic rules approach and devised ten semantic rules in their hybrid approach based on the presentation of BIBREF16 . We use five rules in the semantic rules set because other five rules are only used to compute polarity of words after POS tagging or Parsing steps. We follow the same naming convention for rules utilized by BIBREF11 to represent the rules utilized in our proposed method. The rules utilized in the proposed method are displayed in Table TABREF15 in which is included examples from STS Corpus and output after using the rules. Table TABREF16 illustrates the number of processed sentences on each dataset.\n\n"

  "title": "Learning with Noisy Labels for Sentence-level Sentiment Classification",
  "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) can fit (or even over-fit) the training data very well. If a DNN model is trained using data with noisy labels and tested on data with clean labels, the model may perform poorly. This paper studies the problem of learning with noisy labels for sentence-level sentiment classification. We propose a novel DNN model called NetAb (as shorthand for convolutional neural Networks with Ab-networks) to handle noisy labels during training. NetAb consists of two convolutional neural networks, one with a noise transition layer for dealing with the input noisy labels and the other for predicting 'clean' labels. We train the two networks using their respective loss functions in a mutual reinforcement manner. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",
  "question": "What is the performance of the model?",
  "answer": "Experiment 1: ACC around 0.5 with 50% noise rate in worst case - clearly higher than baselines for all noise rates\nExperiment 2: ACC on real noisy datasets: 0.7 on Movie, 0.79 on Laptop, 0.86 on Restaurant (clearly higher than baselines in almost all cases)",
  "evidence": "Experiments\n-----\nThe test accuracy curves with the noise rates [0, $0.1$, $0.2$, $0.3$, $0.4$, $0.5$] are shown in Figure FIGREF13. From the figure, we can see that the test accuracy drops from around 0.8 to 0.5 when the noise rate increases from 0 to 0.5, but our NetAb outperforms CNN. The results clearly show that the performance of the CNN drops quite a lot with the noise rate increasing.\n\nExperiments\n-----\nThe comparison results are shown in Table TABREF12. From the results, we can make the following observations. (1) Our NetAb model achieves the best ACC and F1 on all datasets except for F1 of negative class on Laptop. The results demonstrate the superiority of NetAb. (2) NetAb outperforms the baselines designed for learning with noisy labels. These baselines are inferior to ours as they were tailored for image classification. Note that we found no existing method to deal with noisy labels for SSC. Training Details. We use the publicly available pre-trained embedding GloVe.840B BIBREF48 to initialize the word vectors and the embedding dimension is 300.\n\n"

  "question": "What learning paradigms do they cover in this survey?",
  "answer": "Considering \"What\" and \"How\" separately versus jointly optimizing for both.",
  "evidence": "Learning Paradigm\n-----\nPast research took a reductionist approach, separately considering these two problems of \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d via content selection and question construction. Given a sentence or a paragraph as input, content selection selects a particular salient topic worthwhile to ask about and determines the question type (What, When, Who, etc.). Approaches either take a syntactic BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 or semantic BIBREF14 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 tack, both starting by applying syntactic or semantic parsing, respectively, to obtain intermediate symbolic representations. Question construction then converts intermediate representations to a natural language question, taking either a tranformation- or template-based approach. The former BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF13 rearranges the surface form of the input sentence to produce the question; the latter BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 generates questions from pre-defined question templates. Unfortunately, such QG architectures are limiting, as their representation is confined to the variety of intermediate representations, transformation rules or templates.\n\nLearning Paradigm\n-----\nIn contrast, neural models motivate an end-to-end architectures. Deep learned frameworks contrast with the reductionist approach, admitting approaches that jointly optimize for both the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d in an unified framework. The majority of current NQG models follow the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) framework that use a unified representation and joint learning of content selection (via the encoder) and question construction (via the decoder). In this framework, traditional parsing-based content selection has been replaced by more flexible approaches such as attention BIBREF22 and copying mechanism BIBREF23 . Question construction has become completely data-driven, requiring far less labor compared to transformation rules, enabling better language flexibility compared to question templates.\n\n"

  "title": "Natural Language State Representation for Reinforcement Learning",
  "abstract": "Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning have highlighted the difficulties in learning within complex high dimensional domains. We argue that one of the main reasons that current approaches do not perform well, is that the information is represented sub-optimally. A natural way to describe what we observe, is through natural language. In this paper, we implement a natural language state representation to learn and complete tasks. Our experiments suggest that natural language based agents are more robust, converge faster and perform better than vision based agents, showing the benefit of using natural language representations for Reinforcement Learning.",
  "question": "What result from experiments suggest that natural language based agents are more robust?",
  "answer": "Average reward across 5 seeds show that NLP representations are robust to changes in the environment as well task-nuisances",
  "evidence": "Semantic State Representations in the Doom Environment ::: Experiments\n-----\nResults of the DQN-based agent are presented in fig: scenario comparison. Each plot depicts the average reward (across 5 seeds) of all representations methods. It can be seen that the NLP representation outperforms the other methods. This is contrary to the fact that it contains the same information as the semantic segmentation maps. More interestingly, comparing the vision-based and feature-based representations render inconsistent conclusions with respect to their relative performance. NLP representations remain robust to changes in the environment as well as task-nuisances in the state. As depicted in fig: nuisance scenarios, inflating the state space with task-nuisances impairs the performance of all representations. There, a large amount of unnecessary objects were spawned in the level, increasing the state's description length to over 250 words, whilst retaining the same amount of useful information. Nevertheless, the NLP representation outperformed the vision and feature based representations, with high robustness to the applied noise.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Understanding audio-visual content and the ability to have an informative conversation about it have both been challenging areas for intelligent systems. The Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog (AVSD) challenge, organized as a track of the Dialog System Technology Challenge 7 (DSTC7), proposes a combined task, where a system has to answer questions pertaining to a video given a dialogue with previous question-answer pairs and the video itself. We propose for this task a hierarchical encoder-decoder model which computes a multi-modal embedding of the dialogue context. It first embeds the dialogue history using two LSTMs. We extract video and audio frames at regular intervals and compute semantic features using pre-trained I3D and VGGish models, respectively. Before summarizing both modalities into fixed-length vectors using LSTMs, we use FiLM blocks to condition them on the embeddings of the current question, which allows us to reduce the dimensionality considerably. Finally, we use an LSTM decoder that we train with scheduled sampling and evaluate using beam search. Compared to the modality-fusing baseline model released by the AVSD challenge organizers, our model achieves a relative improvements of more than 16%, scoring 0.36 BLEU-4 and more than 33%, scoring 0.997 CIDEr.",

  "abstract": "Monotonicity reasoning is one of the important reasoning skills for any intelligent natural language inference (NLI) model in that it requires the ability to capture the interaction between lexical and syntactic structures. Since no test set has been developed for monotonicity reasoning with wide coverage, it is still unclear whether neural models can perform monotonicity reasoning in a proper way. To investigate this issue, we introduce the Monotonicity Entailment Dataset (MED). Performance by state-of-the-art NLI models on the new test set is substantially worse, under 55%, especially on downward reasoning. In addition, analysis using a monotonicity-driven data augmentation method showed that these models might be limited in their generalization ability in upward and downward reasoning.",
  "question": "How do they define upward and downward reasoning?",

On the other hand, a downward entailing context (shown by [... $\\leavevmode {\\color {blue!80!black}\\downarrow }$ ]) allows an inference from ( \"Introduction\" ) to ( \"Introduction\" ), where workers is replaced by a more specific concept new workers. Interestingly, the direction of monotonicity can be reversed again by embedding yet another downward entailing context (e.g., not in ( \"Introduction\" )), as witness the fact that ( \"Introduction\" ) entails ( \"Introduction\" ). To properly handle both directions of monotonicity, NLI models must detect monotonicity operators (e.g., all, not) and their arguments from the syntactic structure.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Audiovisual synchronisation is the task of determining the time offset between speech audio and a video recording of the articulators. In child speech therapy, audio and ultrasound videos of the tongue are captured using instruments which rely on hardware to synchronise the two modalities at recording time. Hardware synchronisation can fail in practice, and no mechanism exists to synchronise the signals post hoc. To address this problem, we employ a two-stream neural network which exploits the correlation between the two modalities to find the offset. We train our model on recordings from 69 speakers, and show that it correctly synchronises 82.9% of test utterances from unseen therapy sessions and unseen speakers, thus considerably reducing the number of utterances to be manually synchronised. An analysis of model performance on the test utterances shows that directed phone articulations are more difficult to automatically synchronise compared to utterances containing natural variation in speech such as words, sentences, or conversations.",

This paper aims to quantify how this diversity impacts state-of-the-art NER methods, by measuring named entity (NE) and context variability, feature sparsity, and their effects on precision and recall. In particular, our findings indicate that NER approaches struggle to generalise in diverse genres with limited training data. Unseen NEs, in particular, play an important role, which have a higher incidence in diverse genres such as social media than in more regular genres such as newswire. Coupled with a higher incidence of unseen features more generally and the lack of large training corpora, this leads to significantly lower F1 scores for diverse genres as compared to more regular ones. We also find that leading systems rely heavily on surface forms found in training data, having problems generalising beyond these, and offer explanations for this observation.",

It can be utilized as a preprocessing tool to segment the words in agglutinative languages for other natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Experimental results show that our morphologically motivated word segmentation method is better suitable for the NMT model, which achieves significant improvements on Turkish-English and Uyghur-Chinese machine translation tasks on account of reducing data sparseness and language complexity.",
  "question": "How is morphology knowledge implemented in the method?",
  "answer": "A BPE model is applied to the stem after morpheme segmentation.",
  "evidence": "Approach ::: Morphologically Motivated Segmentation\n-----\nThe problem with morpheme segmentation is that the vocabulary of stem units is still very large, which leads to many rare and unknown words at the training time. The problem with BPE is that it do not consider the morpheme boundaries inside words, which might cause a loss of morphological properties and semantic information. Hence, on the analyses of the above popular word segmentation methods, we propose the morphologically motivated segmentation strategy that combines the morpheme segmentation and BPE for further improving the translation performance of NMT.\n\nApproach ::: Morphologically Motivated Segmentation\n-----\nCompared with the sentence of word surface forms, the corresponding sentence of stem units only contains the structure information without considering morphological information, which can make better generalization over inflectional variants of the same word and reduce data sparseness BIBREF8. Therefore, we learn a BPE model on the stem units in the training corpus rather than the words, and then apply it on the stem unit of each word after morpheme segmentation.\n\n"

  "abstract": "How does knowledge of one language's morphology influence learning of inflection rules in a second one? In order to investigate this question in artificial neural network models, we perform experiments with a sequence-to-sequence architecture, which we train on different combinations of eight source and three target languages. A detailed analysis of the model outputs suggests the following conclusions: (i) if source and target language are closely related, acquisition of the target language's inflectional morphology constitutes an easier task for the model; (ii) knowledge of a prefixing (resp. suffixing) language makes acquisition of a suffixing (resp. prefixing) language's morphology more challenging; and (iii) surprisingly, a source language which exhibits an agglutinative morphology simplifies learning of a second language's inflectional morphology, independent of their relatedness.",

  "answer": "Comparison of test accuracies of neural network models on an inflection task and qualitative analysis of the errors",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nNeural network models, and specifically sequence-to-sequence models, have pushed the state of the art for morphological inflection \u2013 the task of learning a mapping from lemmata to their inflected forms \u2013 in the last years BIBREF6. Thus, in this work, we experiment on such models, asking not what they learn, but, motivated by the respective research on human subjects, the related question of how what they learn depends on their prior knowledge. We manually investigate the errors made by artificial neural networks for morphological inflection in a target language after pretraining on different source languages. We aim at finding answers to two main questions: (i) Do errors systematically differ between source languages? (ii) Do these differences seem explainable, given the properties of the source and target languages? In other words, we are interested in exploring if and how L2 acquisition of morphological inflection depends on the L1, i.e., the \"native language\", in neural network models.\n\nQualitative Results\n-----\nFor our qualitative analysis, we make use of the validation set. Therefore, we show validation set accuracies in Table TABREF19 for comparison. As we can see, the results are similar to the test set results for all language combinations. We manually annotate the outputs for the first 75 development examples for each source\u2013target language combination. All found errors are categorized as belonging to one of the following categories.\n\n"

From the optimization perspective, residual connections are adopted to improve learning performance for both encoder and decoder in most of these deep architectures, and advanced attention connections are applied as well. Inspired by the success of the DenseNet model in computer vision problems, in this paper, we propose a densely connected NMT architecture (DenseNMT) that is able to train more efficiently for NMT.

  "title": "Casting Light on Invisible Cities: Computationally Engaging with Literary Criticism",
  "abstract": "Literary critics often attempt to uncover meaning in a single work of literature through careful reading and analysis. Applying natural language processing methods to aid in such literary analyses remains a challenge in digital humanities. While most previous work focuses on\"distant reading\"by algorithmically discovering high-level patterns from large collections of literary works, here we sharpen the focus of our methods to a single literary theory about Italo Calvino's postmodern novel Invisible Cities, which consists of 55 short descriptions of imaginary cities. Calvino has provided a classification of these cities into eleven thematic groups, but literary scholars disagree as to how trustworthy his categorization is. Due to the unique structure of this novel, we can computationally weigh in on this debate: we leverage pretrained contextualized representations to embed each city's description and use unsupervised methods to cluster these embeddings. Additionally, we compare results of our computational approach to similarity judgments generated by human readers. Our work is a first step towards incorporating natural language processing into literary criticism.",

While the overall correlation with Calvino's labels is low, both computers and humans can reliably identify some thematic groups associated with concrete objects.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Can neural nets learn logic? We approach this classic question with current methods, and demonstrate that recurrent neural networks can learn to recognize first order logical entailment relations between expressions. We define an artificial language in first-order predicate logic, generate a large dataset of sample 'sentences', and use an automatic theorem prover to infer the relation between random pairs of such sentences. We describe a Siamese neural architecture trained to predict the logical relation, and experiment with recurrent and recursive networks. Siamese Recurrent Networks are surprisingly successful at the entailment recognition task, reaching near perfect performance on novel sentences (consisting of known words), and even outperforming recursive networks. We report a series of experiments to test the ability of the models to perform compositional generalization. In particular, we study how they deal with sentences of unseen length, and sentences containing unseen words. We show that set-ups using LSTMs and GRUs obtain high scores on these tests, demonstrating a form of compositionality.",

  "abstract": "Gender stereotypes are manifest in most of the world's languages and are consequently propagated or amplified by NLP systems. Although research has focused on mitigating gender stereotypes in English, the approaches that are commonly employed produce ungrammatical sentences in morphologically rich languages. We present a novel approach for converting between masculine-inflected and feminine-inflected sentences in such languages. For Spanish and Hebrew, our approach achieves F1 scores of 82% and 73% at the level of tags and accuracies of 90% and 87% at the level of forms. By evaluating our approach using four different languages, we show that, on average, it reduces gender stereotyping by a factor of 2.5 without any sacrifice to grammaticality.",

  "answer": "Because, unlike other languages, English does not mark grammatical genders",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nTo date, the NLP community has focused primarily on approaches for detecting and mitigating gender stereotypes in English BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 . Yet, gender stereotypes also exist in other languages because they are a function of society, not of grammar. Moreover, because English does not mark grammatical gender, approaches developed for English are not transferable to morphologically rich languages that exhibit gender agreement BIBREF8 . In these languages, the words in a sentence are marked with morphological endings that reflect the grammatical gender of the surrounding nouns. This means that if the gender of one word changes, the others have to be updated to match. As a result, simple heuristics, such as augmenting a corpus with additional sentences in which he and she have been swapped BIBREF9 , will yield ungrammatical sentences. Consider the Spanish phrase el ingeniero experto (the skilled engineer). Replacing ingeniero with ingeniera is insufficient\u2014el must also be replaced with la and experto with experta.\n\n"

Previous works verified their proposed methods in limited scenarios, which motivates us to conduct an exploratory study on context modeling methods under real-world semantic parsing in context. We present a grammar-based decoding semantic parser and adapt typical context modeling methods on top of it. We evaluate 13 context modeling methods on two large complex cross-domain datasets, and our best model achieves state-of-the-art performances on both datasets with significant improvements. Furthermore, we summarize the most frequent contextual phenomena, with a fine-grained analysis on representative models, which may shed light on potential research directions.",

The experimental results on BERT-based models show the same trend. Diving deep into the methods only using recent questions as context, we observe that Concat and Turn perform competitively, outperforming Gate by a large margin. With respect to the methods only using precedent SQL as context, Action Copy significantly surpasses Tree Copy and SQL Attn in all metrics. In addition, we observe that there is little difference in the performance of Action Copy and Concat, which implies that using precedent SQL as context gives almost the same effect with using recent questions.

  "title": "HIBERT: Document Level Pre-training of Hierarchical Bidirectional Transformers for Document Summarization",
  "abstract": "Neural extractive summarization models usually employ a hierarchical encoder for document encoding and they are trained using sentence-level labels, which are created heuristically using rule-based methods. Training the hierarchical encoder with these \\emph{inaccurate} labels is challenging. Inspired by the recent work on pre-training transformer sentence encoders \\cite{devlin:2018:arxiv}, we propose {\\sc Hibert} (as shorthand for {\\bf HI}erachical {\\bf B}idirectional {\\bf E}ncoder {\\bf R}epresentations from {\\bf T}ransformers) for document encoding and a method to pre-train it using unlabeled data. We apply the pre-trained {\\sc Hibert} to our summarization model and it outperforms its randomly initialized counterpart by 1.25 ROUGE on the CNN/Dailymail dataset and by 2.0 ROUGE on a version of New York Times dataset. We also achieve the state-of-the-art performance on these two datasets.",
  "question": "Is the baseline a non-heirarchical model like BERT?",
  "answer": "There were hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines; BERT was one of those baselines",
  "evidence": "Results\n-----\nOur main results on the CNNDM dataset are shown in Table 1 , with abstractive models in the top block and extractive models in the bottom block. Pointer+Coverage BIBREF9 , Abstract-ML+RL BIBREF10 and DCA BIBREF42 are all sequence to sequence learning based models with copy and coverage modeling, reinforcement learning and deep communicating agents extensions. SentRewrite BIBREF26 and InconsisLoss BIBREF25 all try to decompose the word by word summary generation into sentence selection from document and \u201csentence\u201d level summarization (or compression). Bottom-Up BIBREF27 generates summaries by combines a word prediction model with the decoder attention model. The extractive models are usually based on hierarchical encoders (SummaRuNNer; BIBREF3 and NeuSum; BIBREF11 ). They have been extended with reinforcement learning (Refresh; BIBREF4 and BanditSum; BIBREF20 ), Maximal Marginal Relevance (NeuSum-MMR; BIBREF21 ), latent variable modeling (LatentSum; BIBREF5 ) and syntactic compression (JECS; BIBREF38 ). Lead3 is a baseline which simply selects the first three sentences. Our model $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$ (in-domain), which only use one pre-training stage on the in-domain CNNDM training set, outperforms all of them and differences between them are all significant with a 0.95 confidence interval (estimated with the ROUGE script). Note that pre-training $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$ (in-domain) is very fast and it only takes around 30 minutes for one epoch on the CNNDM training set. Our models with two pre-training stages ( $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$ ) or larger size ( $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_M$ ) perform even better and $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_M$ outperforms BERT by 0.5 ROUGE. We also implemented two baselines. One is the hierarchical transformer summarization model (HeriTransfomer; described in \"Extractive Summarization\" ) without pre-training. Note the setting for HeriTransfomer is ( $L=4$ , $H=300$ and $A=4$ ) . We can see that the pre-training (details in Section \"Pre-training\" ) leads to a +1.25 ROUGE improvement. Another baseline is based on a pre-trained BERT BIBREF0 and finetuned on the CNNDM dataset. We used the $\\text{BERT}_{\\text{base}}$ model because our 16G RAM V100 GPU cannot fit $\\text{BERT}_{\\text{large}}$ for the summarization task even with batch size of 1. The positional embedding of BERT supports input length up to 512 words, we therefore split documents with more than 10 sentences into multiple blocks (each block with 10 sentences). We feed each block (the BOS and EOS tokens of each sentence are replaced with [CLS] and [SEP] tokens) into BERT and use the representation at [CLS] token to classify each sentence. Our model $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$1 outperforms BERT by 0.4 to 0.5 ROUGE despite with only half the number of model parameters ( $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$2 54.6M v.s. BERT 110M). Results on the NYT50 dataset show the similar trends (see Table 2 ). EXTRACTION is a extractive model based hierarchical LSTM and we use the numbers reported by xu:2019:arxiv. The improvement of $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$3 over the baseline without pre-training (HeriTransformer) becomes 2.0 ROUGE. $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$4 (in-domain), $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$5 (in-domain), $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$6 and $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$7 all outperform BERT significantly according to the ROUGE script.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Research in the social sciences and psychology has shown that the persuasiveness of an argument depends not only the language employed, but also on attributes of the source/communicator, the audience, and the appropriateness and strength of the argument's claims given the pragmatic and discourse context of the argument. Among these characteristics of persuasive arguments, prior work in NLP does not explicitly investigate the effect of the pragmatic and discourse context when determining argument quality. This paper presents a new dataset to initiate the study of this aspect of argumentation: it consists of a diverse collection of arguments covering 741 controversial topics and comprising over 47,000 claims. We further propose predictive models that incorporate the pragmatic and discourse context of argumentative claims and show that they outperform models that rely only on claim-specific linguistic features for predicting the perceived impact of individual claims within a particular line of argument.",

Although the BiLSTM model with attention and FastText baselines performs better than the SVM with distance from the thesis and linguistic features, it has similar performance to the parent quality baseline.\n\nResults and Analysis\n-----\nWe find that the flat representation of the context achieves the highest F1 score. It may be more difficult for the models with a larger number of parameters to perform better than the flat representation since the dataset is small.

However considering the vocabulary was reduced to $V^* = 52$ words, those results lacked of consistency. Therefore for both languages we decided to re-train the RNNs using the same architecture, but with a larger vocabulary of the $V=300$ most relevant words (still in the RF sense) and on all the available data (i.e. everything is used as training) to compensate for the increased size of the vocabulary. We then calculated the distance of a few prominent words to the others. The analysis of the average cosine distance over $B=10$ runs for three major words is given by tables TABREF38 and TABREF39, and three other examples are given in the appendix tables TABREF57 and TABREF58.

Consequently this work represents a significant break with traditional methods, and we do not intend to best state-of-the-art approaches. Textual information is naturally more fuzzy than numerical one, and as such the same accuracy is not expected from the presented approaches. With a single text, we were already able to predict the electricity consumption with a relative error of less than 5% for both data sets. Furthermore, the quality of our predictions of temperature and wind speed is satisfying enough to replace missing or unavailable data in traditional models. Two different approaches are considered to represent the text numerically, as well as multiple forecasting algorithms. Our empirical results are consistent across encoding, methods and language, thus proving the intrinsic value weather reports have for the prediction of the aforementioned time series. Moreover, a major distinction between previous works is our interpretation of the models. We quantify the impact of a word on the forecast and analyze the geometric properties of the word embedding we trained ourselves. Note that although multiple time series are discussed in our paper, the main focus of this paper remains electricity consumption. As such, emphasis is put on the predictive results on the load demand time series.\n\n"

We evaluate our system on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2016 Task 6 and also compare it with the state-of-the-art systems on Stance Sentiment Emotion Corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed system improves the performance of sentiment analysis by 3.2 F-score points on SemEval 2016 Task 6 dataset. Our network also boosts the performance of emotion analysis by 5 F-score points on Stance Sentiment Emotion Corpus.",
  "question": "What are the state-of-the-art systems?",
  "answer": "For sentiment analysis UWB, INF-UFRGS-OPINION-MINING, LitisMind, pkudblab and SVM + n-grams + sentiment and for emotion analysis MaxEnt, SVM, LSTM, BiLSTM and CNN",
  "evidence": "Datasets, Experiments and Analysis ::: Results and Analysis\n-----\nTable TABREF19 shows the comparison of our proposed system with the existing state-of-the-art system of SemEval 2016 Task 6 for the sentiment dataset. BIBREF7 used feature-based SVM, BIBREF39 used keyword rules, LitisMind relied on hashtag rules on external data, BIBREF38 utilized a combination of sentiment classifiers and rules, whereas BIBREF37 used a maximum entropy classifier with domain-specific features. Our system comfortably surpasses the existing best system at SemEval. Our system manages to improve the existing best system of SemEval 2016 task 6 by 3.2 F-score points for sentiment analysis.\n\nDatasets, Experiments and Analysis ::: Results and Analysis\n-----\nWe also compare our system with the state-of-the-art systems proposed by BIBREF15 on the emotion dataset. The comparison is demonstrated in Table TABREF22. Maximum entropy, SVM, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and CNN were the five individual systems used by BIBREF15. Overall, our proposed system achieves an improvement of 5 F-Score points over the existing state-of-the-art system for emotion analysis. Individually, the proposed system improves the existing F-scores for all the emotions except surprise. The findings of BIBREF15 also support this behavior (i.e. worst result for the surprise class). This could be attributed to the data scarcity and a very low agreement between the annotators for the emotion surprise.\n\n"

  "title": "Conversational Intent Understanding for Passengers in Autonomous Vehicles",
  "abstract": "Understanding passenger intents and extracting relevant slots are important building blocks towards developing a contextual dialogue system responsible for handling certain vehicle-passenger interactions in autonomous vehicles (AV). When the passengers give instructions to AMIE (Automated-vehicle Multimodal In-cabin Experience), the agent should parse such commands properly and trigger the appropriate functionality of the AV system. In our AMIE scenarios, we describe usages and support various natural commands for interacting with the vehicle. We collected a multimodal in-cabin data-set with multi-turn dialogues between the passengers and AMIE using a Wizard-of-Oz scheme. We explored various recent Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based techniques and built our own hierarchical models to recognize passenger intents along with relevant slots associated with the action to be performed in AV scenarios. Our experimental results achieved F1-score of 0.91 on utterance-level intent recognition and 0.96 on slot extraction models.",

  "answer": "3347 unique utterances ",
  "evidence": "Methodology\n-----\nOur AV in-cabin data-set includes 30 hours of multimodal data collected from 30 passengers (15 female, 15 male) in 20 rides/sessions. 10 types of passenger intents are identified and annotated as: Set/Change Destination, Set/Change Route (including turn-by-turn instructions), Go Faster, Go Slower, Stop, Park, Pull Over, Drop Off, Open Door, and Other (turn music/radio on/off, open/close window/trunk, change AC/temp, show map, etc.). Relevant slots are identified and annotated as: Location, Position/Direction, Object, Time-Guidance, Person, Gesture/Gaze (this, that, over there, etc.), and None. In addition to utterance-level intent types and their slots, word-level intent keywords are annotated as Intent as well. We obtained 1260 unique utterances having commands to AMIE from our in-cabin data-set. We expanded this data-set via Amazon Mechanical Turk and ended up with 3347 utterances having intents. The annotations for intents and slots are obtained on the transcribed utterances by majority voting of 3 annotators.\n\n"

Individual worker-vs-worker agreement yields 79.8 F1 over 10 experiments with 150 predicates, indicating high consistency across our annotators, inline with results by other structured semantic annotations (e.g. BIBREF6). Overall consistency of the dataset is assessed by measuring agreement between different consolidated annotations, obtained by disjoint triplets of workers, which achieves F1 of 84.1 over 4 experiments, each with 35 distinct predicates. Notably, consolidation boosts agreement, suggesting it is a necessity for semantic annotation consistency.\n\nDataset Quality Analysis ::: Dataset Assessment and Comparison\n-----\nWe assess both our gold standard set and the recent Dense set against an integrated expert annotated sample of 100 predicates. To construct the expert set, we blindly merged the Dense set with our worker annotations and manually corrected them. We further corrected the evaluation decisions, accounting for some automatic evaluation mistakes introduced by the span-matching and question paraphrasing criteria. As seen in Table TABREF19, our gold set yields comparable precision with significantly higher recall, which is in line with our 25% higher yield.\n\nDataset Quality Analysis ::: Agreement with PropBank Data\n-----\nIt is illuminating to observe the agreement between QA-SRL and PropBank (CoNLL-2009) annotations BIBREF7.

  "abstract": "Transferring representations from large supervised tasks to downstream tasks has shown promising results in AI fields such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). In parallel, the recent progress in Machine Translation (MT) has enabled one to train multilingual Neural MT (NMT) systems that can translate between multiple languages and are also capable of performing zero-shot translation. However, little attention has been paid to leveraging representations learned by a multilingual NMT system to enable zero-shot multilinguality in other NLP tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple framework, a multilingual Encoder-Classifier, for cross-lingual transfer learning by reusing the encoder from a multilingual NMT system and stitching it with a task-specific classifier component. Our proposed model achieves significant improvements in the English setup on three benchmark tasks - Amazon Reviews, SST and SNLI. Further, our system can perform classification in a new language for which no classification data was seen during training, showing that zero-shot classification is possible and remarkably competitive. In order to understand the underlying factors contributing to this finding, we conducted a series of analyses on the effect of the shared vocabulary, the training data type for NMT, classifier complexity, encoder representation power, and model generalization on zero-shot performance. Our results provide strong evidence that the representations learned from multilingual NMT systems are widely applicable across languages and tasks.",

We use these two datasets (72 million sentence pairs) to train a single multilingual NMT model to learn both these translation directions simultaneously.

  "abstract": "In visual question answering (VQA), an algorithm must answer text-based questions about images. While multiple datasets for VQA have been created since late 2014, they all have flaws in both their content and the way algorithms are evaluated on them. As a result, evaluation scores are inflated and predominantly determined by answering easier questions, making it difficult to compare different methods. In this paper, we analyze existing VQA algorithms using a new dataset. It contains over 1.6 million questions organized into 12 different categories. We also introduce questions that are meaningless for a given image to force a VQA system to reason about image content. We propose new evaluation schemes that compensate for over-represented question-types and make it easier to study the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms. We analyze the performance of both baseline and state-of-the-art VQA models, including multi-modal compact bilinear pooling (MCB), neural module networks, and recurrent answering units. Our experiments establish how attention helps certain categories more than others, determine which models work better than others, and explain how simple models (e.g. MLP) can surpass more complex models (MCB) by simply learning to answer large, easy question categories.",

Including DAQUAR, six major VQA datasets have been released, and algorithms have rapidly improved. On the most popular dataset, `The VQA Dataset' BIBREF1 , the best algorithms are now approaching 70% accuracy BIBREF2 (human performance is 83%). While these results are promising, there are critical problems with existing datasets in terms of multiple kinds of biases. Moreover, because existing datasets do not group instances into meaningful categories, it is not easy to compare the abilities of individual algorithms. For example, one method may excel at color questions compared to answering questions requiring spatial reasoning. Because color questions are far more common in the dataset, an algorithm that performs well at spatial reasoning will not be appropriately rewarded for that feat due to the evaluation metrics that are used.\n\n"

Based on the new data, we then evaluate three off-the-shelf SRL systems, i.e., the PCFGLA-parser-based, neural-parser-based and neural-syntax-agnostic systems, to gauge how successful SRL for learner Chinese can be. We find two non-obvious facts: 1) the L1-sentence-trained systems performs rather badly on the L2 data; 2) the performance drop from the L1 data to the L2 data of the two parser-based systems is much smaller, indicating the importance of syntactic parsing in SRL for interlanguages. Finally, the paper introduces a new agreement-based model to explore the semantic coherency information in the large-scale L2-L1 parallel data. We then show such information is very effective to enhance SRL for learner texts. Our model achieves an F-score of 72.06, which is a 2.02 point improvement over the best baseline.",
  "question": "Who manually annotated the semantic roles for the set of learner texts?",
  "answer": "Authors",
  "evidence": "An L2-L1 Parallel Corpus\n-----\nIn this paper, we manually annotate the predicate\u2013argument structures for the 600 L2-L1 pairs as the basis for the semantic analysis of learner Chinese. It is from the above corpus that we carefully select 600 pairs of L2-L1 parallel sentences. We would choose the most appropriate one among multiple versions of corrections and recorrect the L1s if necessary. Because word structure is very fundamental for various NLP tasks, our annotation also contains gold word segmentation for both L2 and L1 sentences. Note that there are no natural word boundaries in Chinese text. We first employ a state-of-the-art word segmentation system to produce initial segmentation results and then manually fix segmentation errors.\n\n"

  "title": "Interpretable Visual Question Answering by Visual Grounding from Attention Supervision Mining",
  "abstract": "A key aspect of VQA models that are interpretable is their ability to ground their answers to relevant regions in the image. Current approaches with this capability rely on supervised learning and human annotated groundings to train attention mechanisms inside the VQA architecture. Unfortunately, obtaining human annotations specific for visual grounding is difficult and expensive. In this work, we demonstrate that we can effectively train a VQA architecture with grounding supervision that can be automatically obtained from available region descriptions and object annotations. We also show that our model trained with this mined supervision generates visual groundings that achieve a higher correlation with respect to manually-annotated groundings, meanwhile achieving state-of-the-art VQA accuracy.",
  "question": "How do they obtain region descriptions and object annotations?",
  "answer": "they are available in the Visual Genome dataset",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nIn this work, we introduce a methodology that provides VQA algorithms with the ability to generate human interpretable attention maps which effectively ground the answer to the relevant image regions. We accomplish this by leveraging region descriptions and object annotations available in the Visual Genome dataset, and using these to automatically construct attention maps that can be used for attention supervision, instead of requiring human annotators to manually provide grounding labels. Our framework achieves competitive state-of-the-art VQA performance, while generating visual groundings that outperform other algorithms that use human annotated attention during training.\n\n"

  "title": "Testing the Generalization Power of Neural Network Models Across NLI Benchmarks",
  "abstract": "Neural network models have been very successful in natural language inference, with the best models reaching 90% accuracy in some benchmarks. However, the success of these models turns out to be largely benchmark specific. We show that models trained on a natural language inference dataset drawn from one benchmark fail to perform well in others, even if the notion of inference assumed in these benchmarks is the same or similar. We train six high performing neural network models on different datasets and show that each one of these has problems of generalizing when we replace the original test set with a test set taken from another corpus designed for the same task. In light of these results, we argue that most of the current neural network models are not able to generalize well in the task of natural language inference. We find that using large pre-trained language models helps with transfer learning when the datasets are similar enough. Our results also highlight that the current NLI datasets do not cover the different nuances of inference extensively enough.",
  "question": "Which models were compared?",
  "answer": "BiLSTM-max, HBMP, ESIM, KIM, ESIM + ELMo, and BERT",
  "evidence": "Model and Training Details\n-----\nFor sentence encoding models, we chose a simple one-layer bidirectional LSTM with max pooling (BiLSTM-max) with the hidden size of 600D per direction, used e.g. in InferSent BIBREF17 , and HBMP BIBREF18 . For the other models, we have chosen ESIM BIBREF19 , which includes cross-sentence attention, and KIM BIBREF2 , which has cross-sentence attention and utilizes external knowledge. We also selected two model involving a pre-trained language model, namely ESIM + ELMo BIBREF20 and BERT BIBREF0 . KIM is particularly interesting in this context as it performed significantly better than other models in the Breaking NLI experiment conducted by BIBREF1 . The success of pre-trained language models in multiple NLP tasks make ESIM + ELMo and BERT interesting additions to this experiment. Table 3 lists the different models used in the experiments.\n\n"

  "answer": "They used Wiki Vietnamese language and Vietnamese newspapers to pretrain embeddings and dataset provided in HSD task to train model (details not mentioned in paper).",
  "evidence": "System description ::: System overview\n-----\nThe fundamental idea of this system is how to make a system that has the diversity of viewing an input. That because of the variety of the meaning in Vietnamese language especially with the acronym, teen code type. To make this diversity, after cleaning raw text input, we use multiple types of word tokenizers. Each one of these tokenizers, we combine with some types of representation methods, including word to vector methods such as continuous bag of words BIBREF5, pre-trained embedding as fasttext (trained on Wiki Vietnamese language) BIBREF6 and sonvx (trained on Vietnamese newspaper) BIBREF7. Each sentence has a set of words corresponding to a set of word vectors, and that set of word vectors is a representation of a sentence. We also make a sentence embedding by using RoBERTa architecture BIBREF8. CBOW and RoBERTa models trained on text from some resources including VLSP 2016 Sentiment Analysis, VLSP 2018 Sentiment Analysis, VLSP 2019 HSD and text crawled from Facebook. After having sentence representation, we use some classification models to classify input sentences. Those models will be described in detail in the section SECREF13. With the multiply output results, we will use an ensemble method to combine them and output the final result. Ensemble method we use here is Stacking method will be introduced in the section SECREF16.\n\nExperiment\n-----\nThe dataset in this HSD task is really imbalance. Clean class dominates with 91.5%, offensive class takes 5% and the rest belongs to hate class with 3.5%. To make model being able to learn with this imbalance data, we inject class weight to the loss function with the corresponding ratio (clean, offensive, hate) is $(0.09, 0.95, 0.96)$. Formular DISPLAY_FORM17 is the loss function apply for all models in our system. $w_i$ is the class weight, $y_i$ is the ground truth and $\\hat{y}_i$ is the output of the model. If the class weight is not set, we find that model cannot adjust parameters. The model tends to output all clean classes.\n\n"

  "title": "Using word embeddings to improve the discriminability of co-occurrence text networks",
  "abstract": "Word co-occurrence networks have been employed to analyze texts both in the practical and theoretical scenarios. Despite the relative success in several applications, traditional co-occurrence networks fail in establishing links between similar words whenever they appear distant in the text. Here we investigate whether the use of word embeddings as a tool to create virtual links in co-occurrence networks may improve the quality of classification systems. Our results revealed that the discriminability in the stylometry task is improved when using Glove, Word2Vec and FastText. In addition, we found that optimized results are obtained when stopwords are not disregarded and a simple global thresholding strategy is used to establish virtual links. Because the proposed approach is able to improve the representation of texts as complex networks, we believe that it could be extended to study other natural language processing tasks. Likewise, theoretical languages studies could benefit from the adopted enriched representation of word co-occurrence networks.",
  "question": "Do the use word embeddings alone or they replace some previous features of the model with word embeddings?",
  "answer": "They use it as addition to previous model - they add new edge between words if word embeddings are similar.",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nWhile the co-occurrence representation yields good results in classification scenarios, some important features are not considered in the model. For example, long-range syntactical links, though less frequent than adjacent syntactical relationships, might be disregarded from a simple word adjacency approach BIBREF12. In addition, semantically similar words not sharing the same lemma are mapped into distinct nodes. In order to address these issues, here we introduce a modification of the traditional network representation by establishing additional edges, referred to as \u201cvirtual\u201d edges. In the proposed model, in addition to the co-occurrence edges, we link two nodes (words) if the corresponding word embedding representation is similar. While this approach still does not merge similar nodes into the same concept, similar nodes are explicitly linked via virtual edges.\n\n"

However, the automatic way in which SNLI-VE has been assembled (via combining parts of two related datasets) gives rise to a large number of errors in the labels of this corpus. In this paper, we first present a data collection effort to correct the class with the highest error rate in SNLI-VE. Secondly, we re-evaluate an existing model on the corrected corpus, which we call SNLI-VE-2.0, and provide a quantitative comparison with its performance on the non-corrected corpus.

  "abstract": "While it is well-documented that climate change accepters and deniers have become increasingly polarized in the United States over time, there has been no large-scale examination of whether these individuals are prone to changing their opinions as a result of natural external occurrences. On the sub-population of Twitter users, we examine whether climate change sentiment changes in response to five separate natural disasters occurring in the U.S. in 2018. We begin by showing that relevant tweets can be classified with over 75% accuracy as either accepting or denying climate change when using our methodology to compensate for limited labeled data; results are robust across several machine learning models and yield geographic-level results in line with prior research. We then apply RNNs to conduct a cohort-level analysis showing that the 2018 hurricanes yielded a statistically significant increase in average tweet sentiment affirming climate change. However, this effect does not hold for the 2018 blizzard and wildfires studied, implying that Twitter users' opinions on climate change are fairly ingrained on this subset of natural disasters.",
  "question": "What methodology is used to compensate for limited labelled data?",
  "answer": "Influential tweeters ( who they define as individuals certain to have a classifiable sentiment regarding the topic at hand) is used to label tweets in bulk in the absence of manually-labeled tweets.",

For example, we assume that any tweet composed by Al Gore regarding climate change is a positive sample, whereas any tweet from conspiracy account @ClimateHiJinx is a negative sample. The assumption we make in ensuing methods (confirmed as reasonable in Section SECREF2 ) is that influential tweeters can be used to label tweets in bulk in the absence of manually-labeled tweets. Here, we enforce binary labels for all tweets composed by each of the 133 influential tweeters that we identified on Twitter (87 of whom accept climate change), yielding a total of 16,360 influential tweets.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Identifying and communicating relationships between causes and effects is important for understanding our world, but is affected by language structure, cognitive and emotional biases, and the properties of the communication medium. Despite the increasing importance of social media, much remains unknown about causal statements made online. To study real-world causal attribution, we extract a large-scale corpus of causal statements made on the Twitter social network platform as well as a comparable random control corpus. We compare causal and control statements using statistical language and sentiment analysis tools. We find that causal statements have a number of significant lexical and grammatical differences compared with controls and tend to be more negative in sentiment than controls. Causal statements made online tend to focus on news and current events, medicine and health, or interpersonal relationships, as shown by topic models. By quantifying the features and potential biases of causality communication, this study improves our understanding of the accuracy of information and opinions found online.",

(The spread of causal statements will be considered in future work.) We considered only English-language tweets for this study. To avoid cross-language effects, we kept only tweets with a user-reported language of `English' and, as a second constraint, individual tweets needed to match more English stopwords than any other language's set of stopwords.

  "title": "Dissecting Content and Context in Argumentative Relation Analysis",
  "abstract": "When assessing relations between argumentative units (e.g., support or attack), computational systems often exploit disclosing indicators or markers that are not part of elementary argumentative units (EAUs) themselves, but are gained from their context (position in paragraph, preceding tokens, etc.). We show that this dependency is much stronger than previously assumed. In fact, we show that by completely masking the EAU text spans and only feeding information from their context, a competitive system may function even better. We argue that an argument analysis system that relies more on discourse context than the argument's content is unsafe, since it can easily be tricked. To alleviate this issue, we separate argumentative units from their context such that the system is forced to model and rely on an EAU's content. We show that the resulting classification system is more robust, and argue that such models are better suited for predicting argumentative relations across documents.",

We represent these scores by a one-hot vector of dimension 5 (5 is very positive, 1 is very negative). We determine the contextual ( INLINEFORM0 ) sentiment by looking at the highest possible node of the context which does not contain the EAU (ADVP in Figure FIGREF26 ). The sentiment for an EAU span ( INLINEFORM1 ) is assigned to the highest possible node covering the EAU span which does not contain the context sub-tree (S in Figure FIGREF26 ). The full-access ( INLINEFORM2 ) score is assigned to the lowest possible node which covers both the EAU span and its surrounding context (S' in Figure FIGREF26 ). Next to the sentiment scores for the selected tree nodes and analogously to the word embeddings, we also calculate the element-wise subtraction of the one-hot sentiment source vectors from the one-hot sentiment target vectors.

  "abstract": "The most studied and most successful language models were developed and evaluated mainly for English and other close European languages, such as French, German, etc. It is important to study applicability of these models to other languages. The use of vector space models for Russian was recently studied for multiple corpora, such as Wikipedia, RuWac, lib.ru. These models were evaluated against word semantic similarity task. For our knowledge Twitter was not considered as a corpus for this task, with this work we fill the gap. Results for vectors trained on Twitter corpus are comparable in accuracy with other single-corpus trained models, although the best performance is currently achieved by combination of multiple corpora.",
  "question": "Which Twitter corpus was used to train the word vectors?",
  "answer": "They collected tweets in Russian language using a heuristic query specific to Russian",
  "evidence": "Acquiring data\n-----\nTwitter provides well-documented API, which allows to request any information about Tweets, users and their profiles, with respect to rate limits. There is special type of API, called Streaming API, that provides a real-time stream of tweets. The key difference with regular API is that connection is kept alive as long as possible, and Tweets are sent in real-time to the client. There are three endpoints of Streaming API of our interest: \u201csample\u201d, \u201cfilter\u201d and \u201cfirehose\u201d. The first one provides a sample (random subset) of the full Tweet stream. The second one allows to receive Tweets matching some search criteria: matching to one or more search keywords, produced by subset of users, or coming from certain geo location. The last one provides the full set of Tweets, although it is not available by default. In order to get Twitter \u201cfirehose\u201d one can contact Twitter, or buy this stream from third-parties.\n\nAcquiring data\n-----\nIn our case the simplest approach would be to use \u201csample\u201d endpoint, but it provides Tweets in all possible languages from all over the World, while we are concerned only about one language (Russian). In order to use this endpoint we implemented filtering based on language. The filter is simple: if Tweet does not contain a substring of 3 or more cyrillic symbols, it is considered non-Russian. Although this approach keeps Tweets in Mongolian, Ukrainian and other slavic languages (because they use cyrillic alphabet), the total amount of false-positives in this case is negligible. To demonstrate this we conducted simple experiment: on a random sample of 200 tweets only 5 were in a language different from Russian. In order not to rely on Twitter language detection, we chose to proceed with this method of language-based filtering.\n\nAcquiring data\n-----\nHowever, the amount of Tweets received through \u201csample\u201d endpoint was not satisfying. This is probably because \u201csample\u201d endpoint always streams the same content to all its clients, and small portion of it comes in Russian language. In order to force mining of Tweets in Russian language, we chose \"filter\" endpoint, which requires some search query. We constructed heuristic query, containing some auxiliary words, specific to Russian language: conjunctions, pronouns, prepositions. The full list is as follows:\n\nAcquiring data\n-----\nrussian \u044f, \u0443, \u043a, \u0432, \u043f\u043e, \u043d\u0430, \u0442\u044b, \u043c\u044b, \u0434\u043e, \u043d\u0430, \u043e\u043d\u0430, \u043e\u043d, \u0438, \u0434\u0430.\n\n"

The word embeddings models have the ability to capture the lexical relations between words. Identifying such relationship that connects words is important in NLP applications. We measure that semantic relationship by calculating the dot product of two vectors using Eq. DISPLAY_FORM48. The high cosine similarity score denotes the closer words in the embedding matrix, while less cosine similarity score means the higher distance between word pairs. We present the cosine similarity score of different semantically or syntactically related word pairs taken from the vocabulary in Table TABREF77 along with English translation, which shows the average similarity of 0.632, 0.650, 0.591 yields by CBoW, SG and GloVe respectively. The SG model achieved a high average similarity score of 0.650 followed by CBoW with a 0.632 average similarity score. The GloVe also achieved a considerable average score of 0.591 respectively. However, the average similarity score of SdfastText is 0.388 and the word pair Microsoft-Bill Gates is not available in the vocabulary of SdfastText.

We learn shared vocabularies of 16,000 subword units using the BPE algorithm BIBREF19 . We use newstest2015 as a validation set, and report BLEU on newstest2016.\n\n"

  "abstract": "The recent advances introduced by neural machine translation (NMT) are rapidly expanding the application fields of machine translation, as well as reshaping the quality level to be targeted. In particular, if translations have to fit some given layout, quality should not only be measured in terms of adequacy and fluency, but also length. Exemplary cases are the translation of document files, subtitles, and scripts for dubbing, where the output length should ideally be as close as possible to the length of the input text. This paper addresses for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the problem of controlling the output length in NMT. We investigate two methods for biasing the output length with a transformer architecture: i) conditioning the output to a given target-source length-ratio class and ii) enriching the transformer positional embedding with length information. Our experiments show that both methods can induce the network to generate shorter translations, as well as acquiring interpretable linguistic skills.",

  "answer": "They introduce new trigonometric encoding which besides information about position uses additional length information (abs or relative).",
  "evidence": "Methods ::: Length Encoding Method\n-----\nInspired by BIBREF11, we use length encoding to provide the network with information about the remaining sentence length during decoding. We propose two types of length encoding: absolute and relative. Let pos and len be, respectively, a token position and the end of the sequence, both expressed in terms of number characters. Then, the absolute approach encodes the remaining length:\n\nMethods ::: Length Encoding Method\n-----\nwhere $i=1,\\ldots ,d/2$.\n\nMethods ::: Length Encoding Method\n-----\nSimilarly, the relative difference encodes the relative position to the end. This representation is made consistent with the absolute encoding by quantizing the space of the relative positions into a finite set of $N$ integers:\n\nMethods ::: Length Encoding Method\n-----\nwhere $q_N: [0, 1] \\rightarrow \\lbrace 0, 1, .., N\\rbrace $ is simply defined as $q_N(x) = \\lfloor {x \\times N}\\rfloor $. As we are interested in the character length of the target sequence, len and pos are given in terms of characters, but we represent the sequence as a sequence of BPE-segmented subwords BIBREF17. To solve the ambiguity, len is the character length of the sequence, while pos is the character count of all the preceding tokens. We prefer a representation based on BPE, unlike BIBREF11, as it leads to better translations with less training time BIBREF18, BIBREF19. During training, len is the observed length of the target sentence, while at inference time it is the length of the source sentence, as it is the length that we aim to match.

  "title": "Improving Open Information Extraction via Iterative Rank-Aware Learning",
  "abstract": "Open information extraction (IE) is the task of extracting open-domain assertions from natural language sentences. A key step in open IE is confidence modeling, ranking the extractions based on their estimated quality to adjust precision and recall of extracted assertions. We found that the extraction likelihood, a confidence measure used by current supervised open IE systems, is not well calibrated when comparing the quality of assertions extracted from different sentences. We propose an additional binary classification loss to calibrate the likelihood to make it more globally comparable, and an iterative learning process, where extractions generated by the open IE model are incrementally included as training samples to help the model learn from trial and error. Experiments on OIE2016 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and data are available at https://github.com/jzbjyb/oie_rank.",

  "answer": "No reliability diagrams are provided and no explicit comparison is made between confidence scores or methods.",
  "evidence": "Iterative Learning\n-----\nCompared to using external models for confidence modeling, an advantage of the proposed method is that the base model does not change: the binary classification loss just provides additional supervision. Ideally, the resulting model after one-round of training becomes better not only at confidence modeling, but also at assertion generation, suggesting that extractions of higher quality can be added as training samples to continue this training process iteratively. The resulting iterative learning procedure (alg:iter) incrementally includes extractions generated by the current model as training samples to optimize the binary classification loss to obtain a better model, and this procedure is continued until convergence. [t] training data $\\mathcal {D}$ , initial model $\\theta ^{(0)}$ model after convergence $\\theta $ $t \\leftarrow 0$ # iteration\n\nIntroduction\n-----\nA key step in open IE is confidence modeling, which ranks a list of candidate extractions based on their estimated quality. This is important for downstream tasks, which rely on trade-offs between the precision and recall of extracted assertions. For instance, an open IE-powered medical question answering (QA) system may require its assertions in higher precision (and consequently lower recall) than QA systems for other domains. For supervised open IE systems, the confidence score of an assertion is typically computed based on its extraction likelihood given by the model BIBREF3 , BIBREF5 . However, we observe that this often yields sub-optimal ranking results, with incorrect extractions of one sentence having higher likelihood than correct extractions of another sentence. We hypothesize this is due to the issue of a disconnect between training and test-time objectives. Specifically, the system is trained solely to raise likelihood of gold-standard extractions, and during training the model is not aware of its test-time behavior of ranking a set of system-generated assertions across sentences that potentially include incorrect extractions.\n\nExperimental Settings\n-----\nWe follow the evaluation metrics described by Stanovsky:2016:OIE2016: area under the precision-recall curve (AUC) and F1 score. An extraction is judged as correct if the predicate and arguments include the syntactic head of the gold standard counterparts.\n\n"

  "title": "CRWIZ: A Framework for Crowdsourcing Real-Time Wizard-of-Oz Dialogues",
  "abstract": "Large corpora of task-based and open-domain conversational dialogues are hugely valuable in the field of data-driven dialogue systems. Crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, have been an effective method for collecting such large amounts of data. However, difficulties arise when task-based dialogues require expert domain knowledge or rapid access to domain-relevant information, such as databases for tourism. This will become even more prevalent as dialogue systems become increasingly ambitious, expanding into tasks with high levels of complexity that require collaboration and forward planning, such as in our domain of emergency response. In this paper, we propose CRWIZ: a framework for collecting real-time Wizard of Oz dialogues through crowdsourcing for collaborative, complex tasks. This framework uses semi-guided dialogue to avoid interactions that breach procedures and processes only known to experts, while enabling the capture of a wide variety of interactions. The framework is available at https://github.com/JChiyah/crwiz",
  "question": "Is CRWIZ already used for data collection, what are the results?",
  "answer": "Yes, CRWIZ has been used for data collection and its initial use resulted in 145 dialogues. The average time taken for the task was close to the estimate of 10 minutes, 14 dialogues (9.66%) resolved the emergency in the scenario, and these dialogues rated consistently higher in subjective and objective ratings than those which did not resolve the emergency. Qualitative results showed that participants believed that they were interacting with an automated assistant.",
  "evidence": "Data Analysis\n-----\nFor the intitial data collection using the CRWIZ platform, 145 unique dialogues were collected (each dialogue consists of a conversation between two participants). All the dialogues were manually checked by one of the authors and those where the workers were clearly not partaking in the task or collaborating were removed from the dataset. The average time per assignment was 10 minutes 47 seconds, very close to our initial estimate of 10 minutes, and the task was available for 5 days in AMT. Out of the 145 dialogues, 14 (9.66%) obtained the bonus of $0.2 for resolving the emergency. We predicted that only a small portion of the participants would be able to resolve the emergency in less than 6 minutes, thus it was framed as a bonus challenge rather than a requirement to get paid. The fastest time recorded to resolve the emergency was 4 minutes 13 seconds with a mean of 5 minutes 8 seconds. Table TABREF28 shows several interaction statistics for the data collected compared to the single lab-based WoZ study BIBREF4.\n\nData Analysis ::: Subjective Data\n-----\nTable TABREF33 gives the results from the post-task survey. We observe, that subjective and objective task success are similar in that the dialogues that resolved the emergency were rated consistently higher than the rest.\n\nData Analysis ::: Subjective Data\n-----\nMann-Whitney-U one-tailed tests show that the scores of the Emergency Resolved Dialogues for Q1 and Q2 were significantly higher than the scores of the Emergency Not Resolved Dialogues at the 95% confidence level (Q1: $U = 1654.5$, $p < 0.0001$; Q2: $U = 2195$, $p = 0.009$, both $p < 0.05$). This indicates that effective collaboration and information ease are key to task completion in this setting.\n\nData Analysis ::: Subjective Data\n-----\nRegarding the qualitative data, one of the objectives of the Wizard-of-Oz technique was to make the participant believe that they are interacting with an automated agent and the qualitative feedback seemed to reflect this: \u201cThe AI in the game was not helpful at all [...]\u201d or \u201cI was talking to Fred a bot assistant, I had no other partner in the game\u201c.\n\nData Analysis ::: Single vs Multiple Wizards\n-----\nIn Table TABREF28, we compare various metrics from the dialogues collected with crowdsourcing with the dialogues previously collected in a lab environment for a similar task. Most figures are comparable, except the number of emergency assistant turns (and consequently the total number of turns). To further understand these differences, we have first grouped the dialogue acts in four different broader types: Updates, Actions, Interactions and Requests, and computed the relative frequency of each of these types in both data collections. In addition, Figures FIGREF29 and FIGREF30 show the distribution of the most frequent dialogue acts in the different settings. It is visible that in the lab setting where the interaction was face-to-face with a robot, the Wizard used more Interaction dialogue acts (Table TABREF32). These were often used in context where the Wizard needed to hold the turn while looking for the appropriate prompt or waiting for the robot to arrive at the specified goal in the environment. On the other hand, in the crowdsourced data collection utterances, the situation updates were a more common choice while the assistant was waiting for the robot to travel to the specified goal in the environment.\n\nData Analysis ::: Single vs Multiple Wizards\n-----\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the data shows a medium strong positive correlation between task success and the number of Action type dialogue acts the Wizard performs, triggering events in the world leading to success ($R=0.475$). There is also a positive correlation between task success and the number of Request dialogue acts requesting confirmation before actions ($R=0.421$), e.g., \u201cWhich robot do you want to send?\u201d. As Table 3 shows, these are relatively rare but perhaps reflect a level of collaboration needed to further the task to completion. Table TABREF40 shows one of the dialogues collected where the Emergency Assistant continuously engaged with the Operator through these types of dialogue acts.\n\nData Analysis ::: Single vs Multiple Wizards\n-----\nThe task success rate was also very different between the two set-ups. In experiments reported in BIBREF4, 96% of the dialogues led to the extinction of the fire whereas in the crowdsourcing setting only 9.66% achieved the same goal. In the crowdsourced setting, the robots were slower moving at realistic speeds unlike the lab setting. A higher bonus and more time for the task might lead to a higher task success rate.\n\nData Analysis ::: Limitations\n-----\nIt is important to consider the number of available participants ready and willing to perform the task at any one time. This type of crowdsourcing requires two participants to connect within a few minutes of each other to be partnered together. As mentioned above, there were some issues with participants not collaborating and these dialogues had to be discarded as they were not of use.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are artifacts observed on a network or in an operating system that can be utilized to indicate a computer intrusion and detect cyber-attacks in an early stage. Thus, they exert an important role in the field of cybersecurity. However, state-of-the-art IOCs detection systems rely heavily on hand-crafted features with expert knowledge of cybersecurity, and require large-scale manually annotated corpora to train an IOC classifier. In this paper, we propose using an end-to-end neural-based sequence labelling model to identify IOCs automatically from cybersecurity articles without expert knowledge of cybersecurity. By using a multi-head self-attention module and contextual features, we find that the proposed model is capable of gathering contextual information from texts of cybersecurity articles and performs better in the task of IOC identification.

  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nDistributed representation of word sense provides us with the ability to perform several operations on the word. One of the most important operations on a word is to obtain the set of words whose meaning is similar to the word, or whose usage in text is similar to the word. We call this set the neighbor of the word. When a word has several senses, it is called a polysemic word. When a word has only one sense, it is called a monosemic word. We have observed that the neighbor of a polysemic word consists of words that resemble the primary sense of the polysemic word. We can explain this fact as follows. Even though a word may be a polysemic, it usually corresponds to a single vector in distributed representation. This vector is primarily determined by the major sense, which is most frequently used. The information about a word's minor sense is subtle, and the effect of a minor sense is difficult to distinguish from statistical fluctuation.\n\nIntroduction\n-----\nTo measure the effect of a minor sense, this paper proposes to use the concept of surrounding uniformity. The surrounding uniformity roughly corresponds to statistical fluctuation in the vectors that correspond to the words in the neighbor. We have found that there is a difference in the surrounding uniformity between a monosemic word and a polysemic word. This paper describes how to compute surrounding uniformity for a given word, and discuss the relationship between surrounding uniformity and polysemy.\n\n"

For example, customer service center or hospitals would like to summarize customer service interaction and doctor-patient interaction. However, few researchers explored abstractive summarization on dialogs due to the lack of suitable datasets. We propose an abstractive dialog summarization dataset based on MultiWOZ. If we directly apply previous state-of-the-art document summarization methods on dialogs, there are two significant drawbacks: the informative entities such as restaurant names are difficult to preserve, and the contents from different dialog domains are sometimes mismatched. To address these two drawbacks, we propose Scaffold Pointer Network (SPNet)to utilize the existing annotation on speaker role, semantic slot and dialog domain. SPNet incorporates these semantic scaffolds for dialog summarization. Since ROUGE cannot capture the two drawbacks mentioned, we also propose a new evaluation metric that considers critical informative entities in the text.

If we directly apply previous state-of-the-art document summarization methods on dialogs, there are two significant drawbacks: the informative entities such as restaurant names are difficult to preserve, and the contents from different dialog domains are sometimes mismatched. To address these two drawbacks, we propose Scaffold Pointer Network (SPNet)to utilize the existing annotation on speaker role, semantic slot and dialog domain. SPNet incorporates these semantic scaffolds for dialog summarization. Since ROUGE cannot capture the two drawbacks mentioned, we also propose a new evaluation metric that considers critical informative entities in the text.

  "question": "How does new evaluation metric considers critical informative entities?",
  "answer": "Answer with content missing: (formula for CIC) it accounts for the most important information within each dialog domain. CIC can be applied to any summarization task with predefined essential entities",
  "evidence": "Experimental Settings ::: Evaluation Metrics\n-----\nIn this case, the summary has a high ROUGE score, as it has a considerable proportion of word overlap with the reference summary. However, it still has poor relevance and readability, for leaving out one of the most critical information: [time]. ROUGE treats each word equally in computing n-gram overlap while the informativeness actually varies: common words or phrases (e.g. \u201cYou are going to\") significantly contribute to the ROUGE score and readability, but they are almost irrelevant to essential contents. The semantic slot values (e.g. [restaurant_name], [time]) are more essential compared to other words in the summary. However, ROUGE did not take this into consideration. To address this drawback in ROUGE, we propose a new evaluation metric: Critical Information Completeness (CIC). Formally, CIC is a recall of semantic slot information between a candidate summary and a reference summary. CIC is defined as follows:\n\nExperimental Settings ::: Evaluation Metrics\n-----\nwhere $V$ stands for a set of delexicalized values in the reference summary, $Count_{match}(v)$ is the number of values co-occurring in the candidate summary and reference summary, and $m$ is the number of values in set $V$. In our experiments, CIC is computed as the arithmetic mean over all the dialog domains to retain the overall performance.\n\nExperimental Settings ::: Evaluation Metrics\n-----\nCIC is a suitable complementary metric to ROUGE because it accounts for the most important information within each dialog domain. CIC can be applied to any summarization task with predefined essential entities. For example, in news summarization the proper nouns are the critical information to retain.\n\n"

  "title": "Data Mining in Clinical Trial Text: Transformers for Classification and Question Answering Tasks",
  "abstract": "This research on data extraction methods applies recent advances in natural language processing to evidence synthesis based on medical texts. Texts of interest include abstracts of clinical trials in English and in multilingual contexts. The main focus is on information characterized via the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) framework, but data extraction is not limited to these fields. Recent neural network architectures based on transformers show capacities for transfer learning and increased performance on downstream natural language processing tasks such as universal reading comprehension, brought forward by this architecture's use of contextualized word embeddings and self-attention mechanisms. This paper contributes to solving problems related to ambiguity in PICO sentence prediction tasks, as well as highlighting how annotations for training named entity recognition systems are used to train a high-performing, but nevertheless flexible architecture for question answering in systematic review automation. Additionally, it demonstrates how the problem of insufficient amounts of training annotations for PICO entity extraction is tackled by augmentation. All models in this paper were created with the aim to support systematic review (semi)automation. They achieve high F1 scores, and demonstrate the feasibility of applying transformer-based classification methods to support data mining in the biomedical literature.",
  "question": "What are the problems related to ambiguity in PICO sentence prediction tasks?",
  "answer": "Some sentences are associated to ambiguous dimensions in the hidden state output",
  "evidence": "RESULTS ::: Feature representation and contextualization\n-----\nSentences 1 and 2 are labelled incorrectly, and clearly appear far away from the population class centroid. Sentence 3 is an example of an ambiguous case. It appears very close to the population centroid, but neither its label nor its position reflect the intervention content. This supports a need for multiple tags per sentence, and the fine-tuning of weights within the network.\n\n"

  "abstract": "One of the limitations of semantic parsing approaches to open-domain question answering is the lexicosyntactic gap between natural language questions and knowledge base entries -- there are many ways to ask a question, all with the same answer. In this paper we propose to bridge this gap by generating paraphrases of the input question with the goal that at least one of them will be correctly mapped to a knowledge-base query. We introduce a novel grammar model for paraphrase generation that does not require any sentence-aligned paraphrase corpus. Our key idea is to leverage the flexibility and scalability of latent-variable probabilistic context-free grammars to sample paraphrases. We do an extrinsic evaluation of our paraphrases by plugging them into a semantic parser for Freebase. Our evaluation experiments on the WebQuestions benchmark dataset show that the performance of the semantic parser significantly improves over strong baselines.",

  "answer": "10*n paraphrases, where n depends on the number of paraphrases that contain the entity mention spans",

We use the Stanford CoreNLP caseless tagger for part-of-speech tagging BIBREF38 . For each candidate mention span, we retrieve the top 10 entities according to the Freebase API. We then create a lattice in which the nodes correspond to mention-entity pairs, scored by their Freebase API scores, and the edges encode the fact that no joint assignment of entities to mentions can contain overlapping spans. We take the top 10 paths through the lattice as possible entity disambiguations. For each possibility, we generate $n$ -best paraphrases that contains the entity mention spans. In the end, this process creates a total of $10n$ paraphrases. We generate ungrounded graphs for these paraphrases and treat the final entity disambiguation and paraphrase selection as part of the semantic parsing problem.\n\n"

Our model uses a modified cost function to mitigate inconsistencies in predictions often associated with nonparametric ordinal regression and leverages recent advancements in deep learning to improve prediction accuracy. The proposed method significantly improves on the previous state-of-the-art on Trafficking-10K, an expert-annotated dataset of escort ads.

During each train-test split, INLINEFORM0 of the training set is further reserved as the validation set for tuning hyperparameters such as L2-penalty in IT, AT and LAD, and learning rate in ORNN. So the overall train-validation-test ratio is 70%-20%-10%. We report the mean metrics from the CV in Table TABREF14 . As previous research has pointed out that there is no unbiased estimator of the variance of CV BIBREF29 , we report the naive standard error treating metrics across CV as independent.\n\nComparison with Baselines\n-----\nWe can see that ORNN has the best MAE, INLINEFORM0 and Acc. as well as a close 2nd best Wt.

It is important to note that HTDN is trained using binary labels, whereas the other models are trained using ordinal labels and then have their ordinal predictions converted to binary predictions.

In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient, and effective model for non-autoregressive sequence generation using latent variable models. Specifically, we turn to generative flow, an elegant technique to model complex distributions using neural networks, and design several layers of flow tailored for modeling the conditional density of sequential latent variables. We evaluate this model on three neural machine translation (NMT) benchmark datasets, achieving comparable performance with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive NMT models and almost constant decoding time w.r.t the sequence length.",
  "question": "What is the performance difference between proposed method and state-of-the-arts on these datasets?",
  "answer": "Difference is around 1 BLEU score lower on average than state of the art methods.",
  "evidence": "Experiments ::: Main Results\n-----\nTable TABREF40 illustrates the BLEU scores of FlowSeq and baselines with advanced decoding methods such as iterative refinement, IWD and NPD rescoring. The first block in Table TABREF40 includes the baseline results from autoregressive Transformer. For the sampling procedure in IWD and NPD, we sampled from a reduced-temperature model BIBREF11 to obtain high-quality samples. We vary the temperature within $\\lbrace 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0\\rbrace $ and select the best temperature based on the performance on development sets. The analysis of the impact of sampling temperature and other hyper-parameters on samples is in \u00a7 SECREF50. For FlowSeq, NPD obtains better results than IWD, showing that FlowSeq still falls behind auto-regressive Transformer on model data distributions. Comparing with CMLM BIBREF8 with 10 iterations of refinement, which is a contemporaneous work that achieves state-of-the-art translation performance, FlowSeq obtains competitive performance on both WMT2014 and WMT2016 corpora, with only slight degradation in translation quality. Leveraging iterative refinement to further improve the performance of FlowSeq has been left to future work.\n\n"

  "question": "What was the weakness in Hassan et al's evaluation design?",
  "answer": "MT developers to which crowd workers were compared are usually not professional translators, evaluation of sentences in isolation prevents raters from detecting translation errors, used not originally written Chinese test set\n",
  "evidence": "Background ::: Assessing Human\u2013Machine Parity ::: Choice of Raters\n-----\nThe human evaluation of MT output in research scenarios is typically conducted by crowd workers in order to minimise costs. BIBREF13 shows that aggregated assessments of bilingual crowd workers are very similar to those of MT developers, and BIBREF14, based on experiments with data from WMT 2012, similarly conclude that with proper quality control, MT systems can be evaluated by crowd workers. BIBREF3 also use bilingual crowd workers, but the studies supporting the use of crowdsourcing for MT evaluation were performed with older MT systems, and their findings may not carry over to the evaluation of contemporary higher-quality neural machine translation (NMT) systems. In addition, the MT developers to which crowd workers were compared are usually not professional translators. We hypothesise that expert translators will provide more nuanced ratings than non-experts, and that their ratings will show a higher difference between MT outputs and human translations.\n\nBackground ::: Assessing Human\u2013Machine Parity ::: Linguistic Context\n-----\nMT has been evaluated almost exclusively at the sentence level, owing to the fact that most MT systems do not yet take context across sentence boundaries into account. However, when machine translations are compared to those of professional translators, the omission of linguistic context\u2014e. g., by random ordering of the sentences to be evaluated\u2014does not do justice to humans who, in contrast to most MT systems, can and do take inter-sentential context into account BIBREF15, BIBREF16. We hypothesise that an evaluation of sentences in isolation, as applied by BIBREF3, precludes raters from detecting translation errors that become apparent only when inter-sentential context is available, and that they will judge MT quality less favourably when evaluating full documents.\n\nBackground ::: Assessing Human\u2013Machine Parity ::: Reference Translations\n-----\nThe human reference translations with which machine translations are compared within the scope of a human\u2013machine parity assessment play an important role. BIBREF3 used all source texts of the WMT 2017 Chinese\u2013English test set for their experiments, of which only half were originally written in Chinese; the other half were translated from English into Chinese. Since translated texts are usually simpler than their original counterparts BIBREF17, they should be easier to translate for MT systems. Moreover, different human translations of the same source text sometimes show considerable differences in quality, and a comparison with an MT system only makes sense if the human reference translations are of high quality. BIBREF3, for example, had the WMT source texts re-translated as they were not convinced of the quality of the human translations in the test set. At WMT 2018, the organisers themselves noted that the manual evaluation included several reports of ill-formed reference translations BIBREF5. We hypothesise that the quality of the human translations has a significant effect on findings of human\u2013machine parity, which would indicate that it is necessary to ensure that human translations used to assess parity claims need to be carefully vetted for their quality.\n\n"

  "answer": "In four entity-centric ways - entity-first, entity-last, document-level and sentence-level",
  "evidence": "Entity-Conditioned Models\n-----\nOur approach consists of structuring input to the transformer network to use and guide the self-attention of the transformers, conditioning it on the entity. Our main mode of encoding the input, the entity-first method, is shown in Figure FIGREF4. The input sequence begins with a [START] token, then the entity under consideration, then a [SEP] token. After each sentence, a [CLS] token is used to anchor the prediction for that sentence. In this model, the transformer can always observe the entity it should be primarily \u201cattending to\u201d from the standpoint of building representations. We also have an entity-last variant where the entity is primarily observed just before the classification token to condition the [CLS] token's self-attention accordingly. These variants are naturally more computationally-intensive than post-conditioned models, as we need to rerun the transformer for each distinct entity we want to make a prediction for.\n\nEntity-Conditioned Models ::: Sentence Level vs. Document Level\n-----\nAs an additional variation, we can either run the transformer once per document with multiple [CLS] tokens (a document-level model as shown in Figure FIGREF4) or specialize the prediction to a single timestep (a sentence-level model). In a sentence level model, we formulate each pair of entity $e$ and process step $t$ as a separate instance for our classification task. Thus, for a process with $T$ steps and $m$ entities we get $T \\times m$ input sequences for fine tuning our classification task.\n\n"

Users open some existing documents in a file system, make some changes (e.g. addition, deletion or replacement), and save them as separate documents. These documents become revisions of the original documents. We started from an initial corpus that did not have revisions, and kept adding new documents and revising existing documents. Similar to a file system, at any moment new documents could be added and/or some of the current documents could be revised. The revision operations we used were deletion, addition and replacement of words, sentences, paragraphs, section names and document titles. The addition of words, ..., section names, and new documents were pulled from the Wikipedia abstracts. This corpus generation process had five time periods INLINEFORM0 . Figure FIGREF42 illustrates this simulation. We set a Poisson distribution with rate INLINEFORM1 (the number of documents in the initial corpus) to control the number of new documents added in each time period, and a Poisson distribution with rate INLINEFORM2 to control the number of documents revised in each time period.\n\nData Sets\n-----\nWe generated six data sets using different random seeds, and each data set contained six corpora (Corpus 0 - 5).

We extracted document revisions from Corpus INLINEFORM5 and compared the revisions generated in (Corpus INLINEFORM6 - Corpus INLINEFORM7 ) with the ground truths in Table TABREF48 .

For instance, the training set of the first experiment was Corpus 1. We trained INLINEFORM10 from Corpus 1. We extracted all revisions in Corpus 2, and compared revisions generated in the test set (Corpus 2 - Corpus 1) with the ground truth: 258 revised documents.

  "title": "Evaluating Rewards for Question Generation Models",
  "abstract": "Recent approaches to question generation have used modifications to a Seq2Seq architecture inspired by advances in machine translation. Models are trained using teacher forcing to optimise only the one-step-ahead prediction. However, at test time, the model is asked to generate a whole sequence, causing errors to propagate through the generation process (exposure bias). A number of authors have proposed countering this bias by optimising for a reward that is less tightly coupled to the training data, using reinforcement learning. We optimise directly for quality metrics, including a novel approach using a discriminator learned directly from the training data. We confirm that policy gradient methods can be used to decouple training from the ground truth, leading to increases in the metrics used as rewards. We perform a human evaluation, and show that although these metrics have previously been assumed to be good proxies for question quality, they are poorly aligned with human judgement and the model simply learns to exploit the weaknesses of the reward source.",

The training of reviews pertaining to one domain and evaluation on another domain is widely studied for modeling a domain independent algorithm. This further helps in understanding correlation between domains. In this paper, we show that Gated Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) perform effectively at learning sentiment analysis in a manner where domain dependant knowledge is filtered out using its gates. We perform our experiments on multiple gate architectures: Gated Tanh ReLU Unit (GTRU), Gated Tanh Unit (GTU) and Gated Linear Unit (GLU). Extensive experimentation on two standard datasets relevant to the task, reveal that training with Gated Convolutional Neural Networks give significantly better performance on target domains than regular convolution and recurrent based architectures.

Using CNNs, each vector is built upon the characters that compose the underlying words. As ELMo also contains a deep bi-directional LSTM on top of this character-derived vectors, each word-level embedding contains contextual information from their surroundings.

  "answer": "By visualizing syntactic distance estimated by the parsing network",
  "evidence": "Character-level Language Model\n-----\nIn Figure FIGREF32 , we visualize the syntactic distance estimated by the Parsing Network, while reading three different sequences from the PTB test set. We observe that the syntactic distance tends to be higher between the last character of a word and a space, which is a reasonable breakpoint to separate between words. In other words, if the model sees a space, it will attend on all previous step. If the model sees a letter, it will attend no further then the last space step. The model autonomously discovered to avoid inter-word attention connection, and use the hidden states of space (separator) tokens to summarize previous information. This is strong proof that the model can understand the latent structure of data. As a result our model achieve state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperform baseline models. It is worth noting that HM-LSTM BIBREF6 also unsupervisedly induce similar structure from data. But discrete operations in HM-LSTM make their training procedure more complicated then ours.\n\n"

  "title": "Neural Language Modeling by Jointly Learning Syntax and Lexicon",
  "abstract": "We propose a neural language model capable of unsupervised syntactic structure induction. The model leverages the structure information to form better semantic representations and better language modeling. Standard recurrent neural networks are limited by their structure and fail to efficiently use syntactic information. On the other hand, tree-structured recursive networks usually require additional structural supervision at the cost of human expert annotation. In this paper, We propose a novel neural language model, called the Parsing-Reading-Predict Networks (PRPN), that can simultaneously induce the syntactic structure from unannotated sentences and leverage the inferred structure to learn a better language model.

As shown in Table TABREF42 , our method outperform baseline methods. It is worth noticing that the continuous cache pointer can also be applied to output of our Predict Network without modification. Visualizations of tree structure generated from learned PTB language model are included in Appendix . In Table TABREF40 , we show the value of test perplexity for different variants of PRPN, each variant remove part of the model. By removing Parsing Network, we observe a significant drop of performance. This stands as empirical evidence regarding the benefit of having structure information to control attention.\n\n"

In this paper, we propose a TCM prescription generation task that aims to automatically generate a herbal medicine prescription based on textual symptom descriptions. Sequence-tosequence (seq2seq) model has been successful in dealing with sequence generation tasks. We explore a potential end-to-end solution to the TCM prescription generation task using seq2seq models. However, experiments show that directly applying seq2seq model leads to unfruitful results due to the repetition problem. To solve the problem, we propose a novel decoder with coverage mechanism and a novel soft loss function. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Judged by professors who excel in TCM, the generated prescriptions are rated 7.3 out of 10. It shows that the model can indeed help with the prescribing procedure in real life.",

  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nDuring the long history of TCM, there has been a number of therapy records or treatment guidelines in the TCM classics composed by outstanding TCM researchers and practitioners. In real life, TCM practitioners often take these classical records for reference when prescribing for the patient, which inspires us to design a model that can automatically generate prescriptions by learning from these classics. It also needs to be noted that due to the issues in actual practice, the objective of this work is to generate candidate prescriptions to facilitate the prescribing procedure instead of substituting the human practitioners completely. An example of TCM prescription is shown in Table 1 . The herbs in the prescription are organized in a weak order. By \u201cweak order\u201d, we mean that the effect of the herbs are not influenced by the order. However, the order of the herbs reflects the way of thinking when constructing the prescription. Therefore, the herbs are connected to each other, and the most important ones are usually listed first.\n\n"

Doc2VecC produces significantly better word embeddings than Word2Vec. We compare Doc2VecC with several state-of-the-art document representation learning algorithms. The simple model architecture introduced by Doc2VecC matches or out-performs the state-of-the-art in generating high-quality document representations for sentiment analysis, document classification as well as semantic relatedness tasks. The simplicity of the model enables training on billions of words per hour on a single machine.

Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation.

In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora.

  "title": "A Unified System for Aggression Identification in English Code-Mixed and Uni-Lingual Texts",
  "abstract": "Wide usage of social media platforms has increased the risk of aggression, which results in mental stress and affects the lives of people negatively like psychological agony, fighting behavior, and disrespect to others. Majority of such conversations contains code-mixed languages[28]. Additionally, the way used to express thought or communication style also changes from one social media plat-form to another platform (e.g., communication styles are different in twitter and Facebook). These all have increased the complexity of the problem. To solve these problems, we have introduced a unified and robust multi-modal deep learning architecture which works for English code-mixed dataset and uni-lingual English dataset both.The devised system, uses psycho-linguistic features and very ba-sic linguistic features. Our multi-modal deep learning architecture contains, Deep Pyramid CNN, Pooled BiLSTM, and Disconnected RNN(with Glove and FastText embedding, both). Finally, the system takes the decision based on model averaging. We evaluated our system on English Code-Mixed TRAC 2018 dataset and uni-lingual English dataset obtained from Kaggle. Experimental results show that our proposed system outperforms all the previous approaches on English code-mixed dataset and uni-lingual English dataset.",
  "question": "What data/studies do the authors provide to support the assertion that the majority of aggressive conversations contain code-mixed languages?",
  "answer": "None",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nThe informal setting/environment of social media often encourage multilingual speakers to switch back and forth between languages when speaking or writing. These all resulted in code-mixing and code-switching. Code-mixing refers to the use of linguistic units from different languages in a single utterance or sentence, whereas code-switching refers to the co-occurrence of speech extracts belonging to two different grammatical systemsBIBREF3. This language interchange makes the grammar more complex and thus it becomes tough to handle it by traditional algorithms. Thus the presence of high percentage of code-mixed content in social media text has increased the complexity of the aggression detection task. For example, the dataset provided by the organizers of TRAC-2018 BIBREF0, BIBREF2 is actually a code-mixed dataset.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Knowledge bases of real-world facts about entities and their relationships are useful resources for a variety of natural language processing tasks. However, because knowledge bases are typically incomplete, it is useful to be able to perform link prediction or knowledge base completion, i.e., predict whether a relationship not in the knowledge base is likely to be true. This paper combines insights from several previous link prediction models into a new embedding model STransE that represents each entity as a low-dimensional vector, and each relation by two matrices and a translation vector. STransE is a simple combination of the SE and TransE models, but it obtains better link prediction performance on two benchmark datasets than previous embedding models. Thus, STransE can serve as a new baseline for the more complex models in the link prediction task.",

We expect that the STransE will also be able to serve as the basis for extended models that exploit a wider variety of information sources, just as TransE does.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Online media outlets, in a bid to expand their reach and subsequently increase revenue through ad monetisation, have begun adopting clickbait techniques to lure readers to click on articles. The article fails to fulfill the promise made by the headline. Traditional methods for clickbait detection have relied heavily on feature engineering which, in turn, is dependent on the dataset it is built for. The application of neural networks for this task has only been explored partially. We propose a novel approach considering all information found in a social media post. We train a bidirectional LSTM with an attention mechanism to learn the extent to which a word contributes to the post's clickbait score in a differential manner. We also employ a Siamese net to capture the similarity between source and target information. Information gleaned from images has not been considered in previous approaches. We learn image embeddings from large amounts of data using Convolutional Neural Networks to add another layer of complexity to our model. Finally, we concatenate the outputs from the three separate components, serving it as input to a fully connected layer. We conduct experiments over a test corpus of 19538 social media posts, attaining an F1 score of 65.37% on the dataset bettering the previous state-of-the-art, as well as other proposed approaches, feature engineering or otherwise.",

  "abstract": "Despite strong performance on a variety of tasks, neural sequence models trained with maximum likelihood have been shown to exhibit issues such as length bias and degenerate repetition. We study the related issue of receiving infinite-length sequences from a recurrent language model when using common decoding algorithms. To analyze this issue, we first define inconsistency of a decoding algorithm, meaning that the algorithm can yield an infinite-length sequence that has zero probability under the model. We prove that commonly used incomplete decoding algorithms - greedy search, beam search, top-k sampling, and nucleus sampling - are inconsistent, despite the fact that recurrent language models are trained to produce sequences of finite length. Based on these insights, we propose two remedies which address inconsistency: consistent variants of top-k and nucleus sampling, and a self-terminating recurrent language model. Empirical results show that inconsistency occurs in practice, and that the proposed methods prevent inconsistency.",

  "answer": "It eliminates non-termination in some models fixing for some models up to 6% of non-termination ratio.",
  "evidence": "Empirical Validation ::: Consistency of the Proposed Methods ::: Consistent sampling.\n-----\nTable TABREF44 shows that consistent nucleus and top-$k$ sampling (\u00a7SECREF28) resulted in only terminating sequences, except for a few cases that we attribute to the finite limit $L$ used to measure the non-termination ratio. The example continuations in Table TABREF46 show that the sampling tends to preserve language modeling quality on prefixes that led to termination with the baseline (first row). On prefixes that led to non-termination with the baseline (second & third rows), the quality tends to improve since the continuation now terminates. Since the model's non-$\\left<\\text{eos}\\right>$ token probabilities at each step are only modified by a multiplicative constant, the sampling process can still enter a repetitive cycle (e.g. when the constant is close to 1), though the cycle is guaranteed to eventually terminate.\n\nEmpirical Validation ::: Consistency of the Proposed Methods ::: Self-terminating RNN.\n-----\nFor the example decoded sequences in Table TABREF46, generation quality is similar when both the self-terminating and baseline models terminate (first row). For prefixes that led to non-termination with the baseline, the self-terminating variant can yield a finite sequence with reasonable quality (second row). This suggests that some cases of degenerate repetition BIBREF5, BIBREF10 may be attributed to inconsistency. However, in other cases the self-terminating model enters a repetitive (but finite) cycle that resembles the baseline (third row), showing that consistency does not necessarily eliminate degenerate repetition.\n\n"

  "evidence": "Conclusion\n-----\nWe extended the notion of consistency of a recurrent language model put forward by BIBREF16 to incorporate a decoding algorithm, and used it to analyze the discrepancy between a model and the distribution induced by a decoding algorithm. We proved that incomplete decoding is inconsistent, and proposed two methods to prevent this: consistent decoding and the self-terminating recurrent language model. Using a sequence completion task, we confirmed that empirical inconsistency occurs in practice, and that each method prevents inconsistency while maintaining the quality of generated sequences. We suspect the absence of decoding in maximum likelihood estimation as a cause behind this inconsistency, and suggest investigating sequence-level learning as an alternative in the future.\n\nFuture Directions\n-----\nInconsistency may arise from the lack of decoding in solving this optimization problem. Maximum likelihood learning fits the model $p_{\\theta }$ using the data distribution, whereas a decoded sequence from the trained model follows the distribution $q_{\\mathcal {F}}$ induced by a decoding algorithm. Based on this discrepancy, we make a strong conjecture: we cannot be guaranteed to obtain a good consistent sequence generator using maximum likelihood learning and greedy decoding. Sequence-level learning, however, uses a decoding algorithm during training BIBREF25, BIBREF26. We hypothesize that sequence-level learning can result in a good sequence generator that is consistent with respect to incomplete decoding.\n\n"

  "title": "Modality-Balanced Models for Visual Dialogue",
  "abstract": "The Visual Dialog task requires a model to exploit both image and conversational context information to generate the next response to the dialogue. However, via manual analysis, we find that a large number of conversational questions can be answered by only looking at the image without any access to the context history, while others still need the conversation context to predict the correct answers. We demonstrate that due to this reason, previous joint-modality (history and image) models over-rely on and are more prone to memorizing the dialogue history (e.g., by extracting certain keywords or patterns in the context information), whereas image-only models are more generalizable (because they cannot memorize or extract keywords from history) and perform substantially better at the primary normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) task metric which allows multiple correct answers. Hence, this observation encourages us to explicitly maintain two models, i.e., an image-only model and an image-history joint model, and combine their complementary abilities for a more balanced multimodal model. We present multiple methods for this integration of the two models, via ensemble and consensus dropout fusion with shared parameters. Empirically, our models achieve strong results on the Visual Dialog challenge 2019 (rank 3 on NDCG and high balance across metrics), and substantially outperform the winner of the Visual Dialog challenge 2018 on most metrics.",

  "abstract": "Sentiment analysis provides a useful overview of customer review contents. Many review websites allow a user to enter a summary in addition to a full review. It has been shown that jointly predicting the review summary and the sentiment rating benefits both tasks. However, these methods consider the integration of review and summary information in an implicit manner, which limits their performance to some extent. In this paper, we propose a hierarchically-refined attention network for better exploiting multi-interaction between a review and its summary for sentiment analysis. In particular, the representation of a review is layer-wise refined by attention over the summary representation. Empirical results show that our model can better make use of user-written summaries for review sentiment analysis, and is also more effective compared to existing methods when the user summary is replaced with summary generated by an automatic summarization system.",

Our model outperforms all the baseline models and the top-performing models with both generated summary and golden summary, for all the three datasets. In the scenario where golden summaries are used, BiLSTM+self-attention performs the best among all the baselines, which shows that attention is a useful way to integrate summary and review information. Hard-attention receives more supervision information compared with soft-attention, by supervision signals from extractive summaries. However, it underperforms the soft attention model, which indicates that the most salient words for making sentiment classification may not strictly overlap with extractive summaries. This justifies the importance of user written or automatic-generated summary.\n\nExperiments ::: Datasets\n-----\nWe empirically compare different methods using Amazon SNAP Review Dataset BIBREF20, which is a part of Stanford Network Analysis Project. The raw dataset consists of around 34 millions Amazon reviews in different domains, such as books, games, sports and movies.

In response, data-driven syllabification methods have been developed to learn from syllabified examples. These methods often employ classical machine learning sequence labeling models.

We selected six evaluation languages: English, Dutch, Italian, French, Basque, and Manipuri. These represent two language families (Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan), a language isolate thought to be unrelated to any existing language (Basque), and two different subfamilies within the Indo-European family (West Germanic, Romance). The primary constraint was the availability of syllabified datasets for training and testing. Table TABREF17 presents details of each dataset.\n\nMaterials ::: Datasets\n-----\nAmong the six languages we evaluate with, both English and Dutch are notable for the availability of rich datasets of phonetic and syllabic transcriptions. These are found in the CELEX (Dutch Centre for Lexical Information) database BIBREF16. CELEX was built jointly by the University of Nijmegen, the Institute for Dutch Lexicology in Leiden, the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, and the Institute for Perception Research in Eindhoven. CELEX is maintained by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. The CELEX database contains information on orthography, phonology, morphology, syntax and word frequency. It also contains syllabified words in Dutch and English transcribed using SAM-PA, CELEX, CPA, and DISC notations. The first three are variations of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), in that each uses a standard ASCII character to represent each IPA character. DISC is different than the other three in that it maps a distinct ASCII character to each phone in the sound systems of Dutch, English, and German BIBREF38. Different phonetic transcriptions are used in different datasets. Part of the strength of our proposed syllabifier is that every transcription can be used as-is without any additional modification to the syllabifier or the input sequences. The other datasets were hand-syllabified by linguists with the exception of the IIT-Guwahat dataset and the Festival dataset. Both IIT-Guwahat and Festival were initially syllabified with a naive algorithm and then each entry was confirmed or corrected by hand.\n\n"

While careful regularization and data augmentation are crucial in achieving this level of performance, experiments on Switchboard-2000 show that nothing is more useful than more data.",
  "question": "How much bigger is Switchboard-2000 than Switchboard-300 database?",
  "answer": "Switchboard-2000 contains 1700 more hours of speech data.",
  "evidence": "Experimental setup\n-----\nThis study focuses on Switchboard-300, a standard 300-hour English conversational speech recognition task. Our acoustic and text data preparation follows the Kaldi BIBREF29 s5c recipe. Our attention based seq2seq model is similar to BIBREF30, BIBREF31 and follows the structure of BIBREF32.\n\nExperimental results ::: Experiments on Switchboard-2000\n-----\nAs a contrast to our best results on Switchboard-300, we also train a seq2seq model on the 2000-hour Switchboard+Fisher data. This model consists of 10 encoder layers, and is trained for only 50 epochs. Our overall results on the Hub5'00 and other evaluation sets are summarized in Table TABREF14. The results in Fig. FIGREF12 and Table TABREF14 show that adding more training data greatly improves the system, by around 30% relative in some cases. For comparison with others, the 2000-hour system reaches 8.7% and 7.4% WER on rt02 and rt04. We observe that the regularization techniques, which are extremely important on the 300h setup, are still beneficial but have a significantly smaller effect.\n\n"

  "title": "Harry Potter and the Action Prediction Challenge from Natural Language",
  "abstract": "We explore the challenge of action prediction from textual descriptions of scenes, a testbed to approximate whether text inference can be used to predict upcoming actions. As a case of study, we consider the world of the Harry Potter fantasy novels and inferring what spell will be cast next given a fragment of a story. Spells act as keywords that abstract actions (e.g. 'Alohomora' to open a door) and denote a response to the environment. This idea is used to automatically build HPAC, a corpus containing 82 836 samples and 85 actions. We then evaluate different baselines. Among the tested models, an LSTM-based approach obtains the best performance for frequent actions and large scene descriptions, but approaches such as logistic regression behave well on infrequent actions.",
  "question": "Why do they think this task is hard?  What is the baseline performance?",

  "evidence": "Models\n-----\nAlthough not done in this work, an alternative (but also natural) way to address the task is as a special case of language modelling, where the output vocabulary is restricted to the size of the `action' vocabulary. Also, note that the performance for this task is not expected to achieve a perfect accuracy, as there may be situations where more than one action is reasonable, and also because writers tell a story playing with elements such as surprise or uncertainty.\n\n"

  "title": "Finding Dominant User Utterances And System Responses in Conversations",
  "abstract": "There are several dialog frameworks which allow manual specification of intents and rule based dialog flow. The rule based framework provides good control to dialog designers at the expense of being more time consuming and laborious. The job of a dialog designer can be reduced if we could identify pairs of user intents and corresponding responses automatically from prior conversations between users and agents. In this paper we propose an approach to find these frequent user utterances (which serve as examples for intents) and corresponding agent responses. We propose a novel SimCluster algorithm that extends standard K-means algorithm to simultaneously cluster user utterances and agent utterances by taking their adjacency information into account. The method also aligns these clusters to provide pairs of intents and response groups. We compare our results with those produced by using simple Kmeans clustering on a real dataset and observe upto 10% absolute improvement in F1-scores. Through our experiments on synthetic dataset, we show that our algorithm gains more advantage over K-means algorithm when the data has large variance.",

  "abstract": "The use of irony and sarcasm in social media allows us to study them at scale for the first time. However, their diversity has made it difficult to construct a high-quality corpus of sarcasm in dialogue. Here, we describe the process of creating a large- scale, highly-diverse corpus of online debate forums dialogue, and our novel methods for operationalizing classes of sarcasm in the form of rhetorical questions and hyperbole. We show that we can use lexico-syntactic cues to reliably retrieve sarcastic utterances with high accuracy. To demonstrate the properties and quality of our corpus, we conduct supervised learning experiments with simple features, and show that we achieve both higher precision and F than previous work on sarcasm in debate forums dialogue. We apply a weakly-supervised linguistic pattern learner and qualitatively analyze the linguistic differences in each class.",
  "question": "What are the linguistic differences between each class?",
  "answer": "Each class has different patterns in adjectives, adverbs and verbs for sarcastic and non-sarcastic classes",
  "evidence": "Linguistic Analysis\n-----\nGeneric Sarcasm. We first examine the different patterns learned on the Gen dataset. Table TABREF29 show examples of extracted patterns for each class. We observe that the not-sarcastic patterns appear to capture technical and scientific language, while the sarcastic patterns tend to capture subjective language that is not topic-specific. We observe an abundance of adjective and adverb patterns for the sarcastic class, although we do not use adjective and adverb patterns in our regex retrieval method. Instead, such cues co-occur with the cues we search for, expanding our pattern inventory as we show in Table TABREF31 .\n\nLinguistic Analysis\n-----\nRhetorical Questions. We notice that while the not-sarcastic patterns generated for RQs are similar to the topic-specific not-sarcastic patterns we find in the general dataset, there are some interesting features of the sarcastic patterns that are more unique to the RQs.\n\nLinguistic Analysis\n-----\nMany of our sarcastic questions focus specifically on attacks on the mental abilities of the addressee. This generalization is made clear when we extract and analyze the verb, subject, and object arguments using the Stanford dependency parser BIBREF32 for the questions in the RQ dataset. Table TABREF32 shows a few examples of the relations we extract.\n\nLinguistic Analysis\n-----\nHyperbole. One common pattern for hyperbole involves adverbs and adjectives, as noted above. We did not use this pattern to retrieve hyperbole, but because each hyperbolic sarcastic utterance contains multiple cues, we learn an expanded class of patterns for hyperbole. Table TABREF33 illustrates some of the new adverb adjective patterns that are frequent, high-precision indicators of sarcasm.\n\nLinguistic Analysis\n-----\nWe learn a number of verbal patterns that we had not previously associated with hyperbole, as shown in Table TABREF34 . Interestingly, many of these instantiate the observations of CanoMora2009 on hyperbole and its related semantic fields: creating contrast by exclusion, e.g. no limit and no way, or by expanding a predicated class, e.g. everyone knows.

  "title": "AvgOut: A Simple Output-Probability Measure to Eliminate Dull Responses",
  "abstract": "Many sequence-to-sequence dialogue models tend to generate safe, uninformative responses. There have been various useful efforts on trying to eliminate them. However, these approaches either improve decoding algorithms during inference, rely on hand-crafted features, or employ complex models. In our work, we build dialogue models that are dynamically aware of what utterances or tokens are dull without any feature-engineering. Specifically, we start with a simple yet effective automatic metric, AvgOut, which calculates the average output probability distribution of all time steps on the decoder side during training. This metric directly estimates which tokens are more likely to be generated, thus making it a faithful evaluation of the model diversity (i.e., for diverse models, the token probabilities should be more evenly distributed rather than peaked at a few dull tokens). We then leverage this novel metric to propose three models that promote diversity without losing relevance. The first model, MinAvgOut, directly maximizes the diversity score through the output distributions of each batch; the second model, Label Fine-Tuning (LFT), prepends to the source sequence a label continuously scaled by the diversity score to control the diversity level; the third model, RL, adopts Reinforcement Learning and treats the diversity score as a reward signal. Moreover, we experiment with a hybrid model by combining the loss terms of MinAvgOut and RL. All four models outperform their base LSTM-RNN model on both diversity and relevance by a large margin, and are comparable to or better than competitive baselines (also verified via human evaluation). Moreover, our approaches are orthogonal to the base model, making them applicable as an add-on to other emerging better dialogue models in the future.",

Following BIBREF5 (BIBREF5), we employ two criteria: Plausibility and Content Richness. The first criterion measures whether the response is plausible given the context, while the second gauges whether the response is diverse and informative. The utterances were randomly shuffled to anonymize model identity. We only allowed annotators located in the US-located with at least an approval rate of $98\\%$ and $10,000$ approved HITs.

The F1 results are shown in Table TABREF24. Among all single models, LFT performs the best, followed by MinAvgOut. RL is also comparable with previous state-of-the-art models VHRED (attn) and Reranking-RL. We think that this is because LFT exerts no force in pulling the model predictions away from the ground-truth tokens, but rather just makes itself aware of how dull each response is. Consequently, its responses appear more relevant than the other two approaches. Moreover, the hybrid model (last row) outperforms all other models by a large margin. One might expect that minimizing AVGOUT causes the models to move further away from the ground-truth tokens, so that it will hurt relevance. However, our F1 results show that as the responses become more diverse, they are more likely to include information more related and specific to the input contexts, which actually makes the model gain on both diversity and relevance.

  "title": "Generative Dialog Policy for Task-oriented Dialog Systems",
  "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for task-oriented dialogue systems which can assist users in various activities such as booking tickets and restaurant reservations. In order to complete dialogues effectively, dialogue policy plays a key role in task-oriented dialogue systems. As far as we know, the existing task-oriented dialogue systems obtain the dialogue policy through classification, which can assign either a dialogue act and its corresponding parameters or multiple dialogue acts without their corresponding parameters for a dialogue action. In fact, a good dialogue policy should construct multiple dialogue acts and their corresponding parameters at the same time. However, it's hard for existing classification-based methods to achieve this goal. Thus, to address the issue above, we propose a novel generative dialogue policy learning method. Specifically, the proposed method uses attention mechanism to find relevant segments of given dialogue context and input utterance and then constructs the dialogue policy by a seq2seq way for task-oriented dialogue systems. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, we have publicly released our codes.",

All the models perform very well in BPRA on DSTC2 dataset. On Maluuba dataset, the BPRA decreases because of the complex domains. We can notice that BPRA of CDM is slightly worse than other models on Maluuba dataset, the reason is that the CDM's dialogue policy maker contains lots of classifications and has the bigger loss than other models because of complex domains, which affects the training of the dialogue belief tracker.\n\nExperiments ::: Experimental Results\n-----\nAPRA Results: Compared with baselines, GDP achieves the best performance in APRA on two datasets. It can be noted that we do not compare with the E2ECM baseline in APRA. E2ECM only uses a simple classifier to recognize the label of the acts and ignores the parameters information. In our experiment, APRA of E2ECM is slightly better than our method. Considering the lack of parameters of the acts, it's unfair for our GDP method. Furthermore, the CDM baseline considers the parameters of the act. But GDP is far better than CDM in supervised learning and reinforcement learning.\n\nExperiments ::: Experimental Results\n-----\nBLEU Results: GDP significantly outperforms the baselines on BLEU. As mentioned above, E2ECM is actually slightly better than GDP in APRA. But in fact, we can find that the language quality of the response generated by GDP is still better than E2ECM, which proves that lack of enough parameters information makes it difficult to find the appropriate sentence template in NLG. It can be found that the BLEU of all models is very poor on Maluuba dataset. The reason is that Maluuba is a human-human task-oriented dialogue dataset, the utterances are very flexible, the natural language generator for all methods is difficult to generate an accurate utterance based on the context. And DSTC2 is a human-machine dialog dataset. The response is very regular so the effectiveness of NLG will be better than that of Maluuba. But from the results, the GDP is still better than the baselines on Maluuba dataset, which also verifies that our proposed method is more accurate in modeling dialogue policy on complex domains than the classification-based methods.\n\n"

In this study, we build NMT systems using only synthetic parallel data. As an efficient alternative to real parallel data, we also present a new type of synthetic parallel corpus. The proposed pseudo parallel data are distinct from previous works in that ground truth and synthetic examples are mixed on both sides of sentence pairs. Experiments on Czech-German and French-German translations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed pseudo parallel corpus, which shows not only enhanced results for bidirectional translation tasks but also substantial improvement with the aid of a ground truth real parallel corpus.",
  "question": "How many improvements on the French-German translation benchmark?",
  "answer": "one",
  "evidence": "Results and Analysis\n-----\nWhile the mixing strategy compensates for most of the gap between the Fr-De* and the Fr*-De (3.01 $\\rightarrow $ 0.17) in the De $\\rightarrow $ Fr case, the resulting PSEUDOmix still shows lower BLEU than the target-originated Fr-De* corpus. We thus enhance the quality of the synthetic examples of the source-originated Fr*-De data by further training its mother translation model (En $\\rightarrow $ Fr). As illustrated in Figure 2 , with the target-originated Fr-De* corpus being fixed, the quality of the models trained with the source-originated Fr*-De data and PSEUDOmix increases in proportion to the quality of the mother model for the Fr*-De corpus. Eventually, PSEUDOmix shows the highest BLEU, outperforming both Fr*-De and Fr-De* data. The results indicate that the benefit of the proposed mixing approach becomes much more evident when the quality gap between the source- and target-originated synthetic data is within a certain range.\n\nResults and Analysis\n-----\nAs presented in Table 6 , we observe that fine-tuning using ground truth parallel data brings substantial improvements in the translation qualities of all NMT models. Among all fine-tuned models, PSEUDOmix shows the best performance in all experiments. This is particularly encouraging for the case of De $\\rightarrow $ Fr, where PSEUDOmix reported lower BLEU than the Fr-De* data before it was fine-tuned. Even in the case where PSEUDOmix shows comparable results with other synthetic corpora in the Pseudo Only scenario, it shows higher improvements in the translation quality when fine-tuned with the real parallel data. These results clearly demonstrate the strengths of the proposed PSEUDOmix, which indicate both competitive translation quality by itself and relatively higher potential improvement as a result of the refinement using ground truth parallel corpora.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Dialogue state tracking is an important component in task-oriented dialogue systems to identify users' goals and requests as a dialogue proceeds. However, as most previous models are dependent on dialogue slots, the model complexity soars when the number of slots increases. In this paper, we put forward a slot-independent neural model (SIM) to track dialogue states while keeping the model complexity invariant to the number of dialogue slots. The model utilizes attention mechanisms between user utterance and system actions. SIM achieves state-of-the-art results on WoZ and DSTC2 tasks, with only 20% of the model size of previous models.",
  "question": "How do they prevent the model complexity increasing with the increased number of slots?",
  "answer": "They exclude slot-specific parameters and incorporate better feature representation of user utterance and dialogue states using syntactic information and convolutional neural networks (CNN).",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nTo solve this problem, we need a state tracking model independent of dialogue slots. In other words, the network should depend on the semantic similarity between slots and utterance instead of slot-specific modules. To this end, we propose the Slot-Independent Model (SIM). Our model complexity does not increase when the number of slots in dialogue tasks go up. Thus, SIM has many fewer parameters than existing dialogue state tracking models. To compensate for the exclusion of slot-specific parameters, we incorporate better feature representation of user utterance and dialogue states using syntactic information and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The refined representation, in addition to cross and self-attention mechanisms, make our model achieve even better performance than slot-specific models. For instance, on Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) 2.0 dataset BIBREF8, the SIM model obtains a joint-accuracy score of 89.5%, 1.4% higher than the previously best model GLAD, with only 22% of the number of parameters. On DSTC2 dataset, SIM achieves comparable performance with previous best models with only 19% of the model size.\n\n"

  "title": "SIM: A Slot-Independent Neural Model for Dialogue State Tracking",
  "abstract": "Dialogue state tracking is an important component in task-oriented dialogue systems to identify users' goals and requests as a dialogue proceeds. However, as most previous models are dependent on dialogue slots, the model complexity soars when the number of slots increases. In this paper, we put forward a slot-independent neural model (SIM) to track dialogue states while keeping the model complexity invariant to the number of dialogue slots. The model utilizes attention mechanisms between user utterance and system actions. SIM achieves state-of-the-art results on WoZ and DSTC2 tasks, with only 20% of the model size of previous models.",
  "question": "How do they measure model size?",
  "answer": "By the number of parameters.",
  "evidence": "Experiment ::: Baseline models and result\n-----\nFurthermore, as SIM has no slot-specific neural network structures, its model size is much smaller than previous models. Table TABREF20 shows that, on WoZ and DSTC2 datasets, SIM model has the same number of parameters, which is only 23% and 19% of that in GLAD model.\n\n"

  "title": "Learning General Purpose Distributed Sentence Representations via Large Scale Multi-task Learning",
  "abstract": "A lot of the recent success in natural language processing (NLP) has been driven by distributed vector representations of words trained on large amounts of text in an unsupervised manner. These representations are typically used as general purpose features for words across a range of NLP problems. However, extending this success to learning representations of sequences of words, such as sentences, remains an open problem. Recent work has explored unsupervised as well as supervised learning techniques with different training objectives to learn general purpose fixed-length sentence representations. In this work, we present a simple, effective multi-task learning framework for sentence representations that combines the inductive biases of diverse training objectives in a single model. We train this model on several data sources with multiple training objectives on over 100 million sentences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that sharing a single recurrent sentence encoder across weakly related tasks leads to consistent improvements over previous methods. We present substantial improvements in the context of transfer learning and low-resource settings using our learned general-purpose representations.",

  "title": "A Sentiment Analysis of Breast Cancer Treatment Experiences and Healthcare Perceptions Across Twitter",
  "abstract": "Background: Social media has the capacity to afford the healthcare industry with valuable feedback from patients who reveal and express their medical decision-making process, as well as self-reported quality of life indicators both during and post treatment. In prior work, [Crannell et. al.], we have studied an active cancer patient population on Twitter and compiled a set of tweets describing their experience with this disease. We refer to these online public testimonies as\"Invisible Patient Reported Outcomes\"(iPROs), because they carry relevant indicators, yet are difficult to capture by conventional means of self-report. Methods: Our present study aims to identify tweets related to the patient experience as an additional informative tool for monitoring public health. Using Twitter's public streaming API, we compiled over 5.3 million\"breast cancer\"related tweets spanning September 2016 until mid December 2017. We combined supervised machine learning methods with natural language processing to sift tweets relevant to breast cancer patient experiences. We analyzed a sample of 845 breast cancer patient and survivor accounts, responsible for over 48,000 posts. We investigated tweet content with a hedonometric sentiment analysis to quantitatively extract emotionally charged topics. Results: We found that positive experiences were shared regarding patient treatment, raising support, and spreading awareness. Further discussions related to healthcare were prevalent and largely negative focusing on fear of political legislation that could result in loss of coverage. Conclusions: Social media can provide a positive outlet for patients to discuss their needs and concerns regarding their healthcare coverage and treatment needs. Capturing iPROs from online communication can help inform healthcare professionals and lead to more connected and personalized treatment regimens.",

  "evidence": "Data Description\n-----\nSentence classification combines natural language processing (NLP) with machine learning to identify trends in sentence structure, BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 . Each tweet is converted to a numeric word vector in order to identify distinguishing features by training an NLP classifier on a validated set of relevant tweets. The classifier acts as a tool to sift through ads, news, and comments not related to patients. Our scheme combines a logistic regression classifier, BIBREF16 , with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , to identify self-reported diagnostic tweets.\n\nData Description\n-----\nIt is important to be wary of automated accounts (e.g. bots, spam) whose large output of tweets pollute relevant organic content, BIBREF19 , and can distort sentiment analyses, BIBREF20 . Prior to applying sentence classification, we removed tweets containing hyperlinks to remove automated content (some organic content is necessarily lost with this strict constraint).\n\nData Description\n-----\nOur goal was to analyze content authored only by patients. To help ensure this outcome we removed posts containing a URL for classification, BIBREF19 . Twitter allows users to spread content from other users via `retweets'. We also removed these posts prior to classification to isolate tweets authored by patients. We also accounted for non-relevant astrological content by removing all tweets containing any of the following horoscope indicators: `astrology',`zodiac',`astronomy',`horoscope',`aquarius',`pisces',`aries',`taurus',`leo',`virgo',`libra', and `scorpio'. We preprocessed tweets by lowercasing and removing punctuation. We also only analyzed tweets for which Twitter had identified `en' for the language English.\n\n"

  "title": "Variational Transformers for Diverse Response Generation",
  "abstract": "Despite the great promise of Transformers in many sequence modeling tasks (e.g., machine translation), their deterministic nature hinders them from generalizing to high entropy tasks such as dialogue response generation. Previous work proposes to capture the variability of dialogue responses with a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). However, the autoregressive computation of the RNN limits the training efficiency. Therefore, we propose the Variational Transformer (VT), a variational self-attentive feed-forward sequence model. The VT combines the parallelizability and global receptive field of the Transformer with the variational nature of the CVAE by incorporating stochastic latent variables into Transformers. We explore two types of the VT: 1) modeling the discourse-level diversity with a global latent variable; and 2) augmenting the Transformer decoder with a sequence of fine-grained latent variables. Then, the proposed models are evaluated on three conversational datasets with both automatic metric and human evaluation. The experimental results show that our models improve standard Transformers and other baselines in terms of diversity, semantic relevance, and human judgment.",

BAN uses translation system to translate other language sentences into English and utilizes the pre-trained English NER model to get task-specific information. After that, BAN applies a new mechanism named back attention knowledge transfer to improve the semantic representation, which aids in generation of the result.

  "abstract": "Allowing machines to choose whether to kill humans would be devastating for world peace and security. But how do we equip machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? Jentzsch et al.(2019) showed that applying machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about \"right\" and \"wrong\" conduct by calculating a moral bias score on a sentence level using sentence embeddings. The machine learned that it is objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time; It is essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt; it is important to spread information, yet one should not spread misinformation. However, the evaluated moral bias was restricted to simple actions -- one verb -- and a ranking of actions with surrounding context. Recently BERT ---and variants such as RoBERTa and SBERT--- has set a new state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of NLP tasks. But has BERT also a better moral compass? In this paper, we discuss and show that this is indeed the case. Thus, recent improvements of language representations also improve the representation of the underlying ethical and moral values of the machine. We argue that through an advanced semantic representation of text, BERT allows one to get better insights of moral and ethical values implicitly represented in text. This enables the Moral Choice Machine (MCM) to extract more accurate imprints of moral choices and ethical values.",

  "abstract": "When a bilingual student learns to solve word problems in math, we expect the student to be able to solve these problem in both languages the student is fluent in,even if the math lessons were only taught in one language. However, current representations in machine learning are language dependent. In this work, we present a method to decouple the language from the problem by learning language agnostic representations and therefore allowing training a model in one language and applying to a different one in a zero shot fashion. We learn these representations by taking inspiration from linguistics and formalizing Universal Grammar as an optimization process (Chomsky, 2014; Montague, 1970). We demonstrate the capabilities of these representations by showing that the models trained on a single language using language agnostic representations achieve very similar accuracies in other languages.",
  "question": "What are the languages they consider in this paper?",
  "answer": "The languages considered were English, Chinese, German, Russian, Arabic, Spanish, French",
  "evidence": "Sentiment Analysis\n-----\nTo test this hypothesis we first trained UG-WGAN in English, Chinese and German following the procedure described in Section \"UG-WGAN\" . The embedding size of the table was 300 and the internal LSTM hidden size was 512. A dropout rate of $0.1$ was used and trained with the ADAM optimization method BIBREF23 . Since we are interested in the zero-shot capabilities of our representation, we trained our sentiment analysis model only on the english IMDB Large Movie Review dataset and tested it on the chinese ChnSentiCorp dataset and german SB-10K BIBREF24 , BIBREF25 . We binarize the label's for all the datasets.\n\nNLI\n-----\nFor this experiment we trained UG-WGAN on the English and Russian language following the procedure described in Section \"UG-WGAN\" . We kept the hyper-parameters equivalent to the Sentiment Analysis experiment. All of the NLI model tested were run over the fixed UG embeddings. We trained two different models from literature, Densely-Connected Recurrent and Co-Attentive Network by BIBREF30 and Multiway Attention Network by BIBREF31 . Please refer to this papers for further implementation details.\n\nDiscussion\n-----\nOne way to measure universality is by studying perplexity of our multi-lingual language model as we increase the number of languages. To do so we trained 6 UG-WGAN models on the following languages: English, Russian, Arabic, Chinese, German, Spanish, French. We maintain the same procedure as described above. The hidden size of the language model was increased to 1024 with 16K BPE tokens being used. The first model was trained on English Russian, second was trained on English Russian Arabic and so on. For arabic we still trained from left to right even though naturally the language is read from right to left. We report the results in Figure 5 . As the number of languages increases the gap between a UG-WGAN without any distribution matching and one with diminishes. This implies that the efficiency and representative power of UG-WGAN grows as we increase the number of languages it has to model.\n\n"

  "title": "Same Representation, Different Attentions: Shareable Sentence Representation Learning from Multiple Tasks",
  "abstract": "Distributed representation plays an important role in deep learning based natural language processing. However, the representation of a sentence often varies in different tasks, which is usually learned from scratch and suffers from the limited amounts of training data. In this paper, we claim that a good sentence representation should be invariant and can benefit the various subsequent tasks. To achieve this purpose, we propose a new scheme of information sharing for multi-task learning. More specifically, all tasks share the same sentence representation and each task can select the task-specific information from the shared sentence representation with attention mechanism. The query vector of each task's attention could be either static parameters or generated dynamically. We conduct extensive experiments on 16 different text classification tasks, which demonstrate the benefits of our architecture.",

  "answer": "Accuracy on each dataset and the average accuracy on all datasets.",
  "evidence": "Exp I: Sentiment Classification\n-----\nTable TABREF34 shows the performances of the different methods. From the table, we can see that the performances of most tasks can be improved with the help of multi-task learning. FS-MTL shows the minimum performance gain from multi-task learning since it puts all private and shared information into a unified space. SSP-MTL and PSP-MTL achieve similar performance and are outperformed by ASP-MTL which can better separate the task-specific and task-invariant features by using adversarial training. Our proposed models (SA-MTL and DA-MTL) outperform ASP-MTL because we model a richer representation from these 16 tasks. Compared to SA-MTL, DA-MTL achieves a further improvement of INLINEFORM0 accuracy with the help of the dynamic and flexible query vector. It is noteworthy that our models are also space efficient since the task-specific information is extracted by using only a query vector, instead of a BiLSTM layer in the shared-private models.\n\n"

  "title": "Adversarial Examples with Difficult Common Words for Paraphrase Identification",
  "abstract": "Despite the success of deep models for paraphrase identification on benchmark datasets, these models are still vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to generate a new type of adversarial examples to study the robustness of deep paraphrase identification models. We first sample an original sentence pair from the corpus and then adversarially replace some word pairs with difficult common words. We take multiple steps and use beam search to find a modification solution that makes the target model fail, and thereby obtain an adversarial example. The word replacement is also constrained by heuristic rules and a language model, to preserve the label and grammaticality of the example during modification. Experiments show that our algorithm can generate adversarial examples on which the performance of the target model drops dramatically. Meanwhile, human annotators are much less affected, and the generated sentences retain a good grammaticality. We also show that adversarial training with generated adversarial examples can improve model robustness.",
  "question": "How much in experiments is performance improved for models trained with generated adversarial examples?",
  "answer": "Answer with content missing: (Table 1) The performance of all the target models raises significantly, while that on the original\nexamples remain comparable (e.g. the overall accuracy of BERT on modified examples raises from 24.1% to 66.0% on Quora)",
  "evidence": "Experiments ::: Adversarial Training\n-----\nAdversarial training can often improve model robustness BIBREF25, BIBREF27. We also fine-tune the target models using adversarial training. At each training step, we train the model with a batch of original examples along with adversarial examples with balanced labels. The adversarial examples account for around 10% in a batch. During training, we generate adversarial examples with the current model as the target and update the model parameters with the hybrid batch iteratively. The beam size for generation is set to 1 to reduce the computation cost, since the generation success rate is minor in adversarial training. We evaluate the adversarially trained models, as shown in Table TABREF18.\n\nExperiments ::: Adversarial Training\n-----\nAfter adversarial training, the performance of all the target models raises significantly, while that on the original examples remain comparable. Note that since the focus of this paper is on model robustness which can hardly be reflected in original data, we do not expect performance improvement on original data. The results demonstrate that adversarial training with our adversarial examples can significantly improve the robustness we focus on without remarkably hurting the performance on original data. Moreover, although the adversarial example generation is constrained by a BERT language model, BiMPM and DIIN which do not use the BERT language model can also significantly benefit from the adversarial examples, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.\n\n"

  "title": "A Neural Approach to Discourse Relation Signal Detection",
  "abstract": "Previous data-driven work investigating the types and distributions of discourse relation signals, including discourse markers such as 'however' or phrases such as 'as a result' has focused on the relative frequencies of signal words within and outside text from each discourse relation. Such approaches do not allow us to quantify the signaling strength of individual instances of a signal on a scale (e.g. more or less discourse-relevant instances of 'and'), to assess the distribution of ambiguity for signals, or to identify words that hinder discourse relation identification in context ('anti-signals' or 'distractors'). In this paper we present a data-driven approach to signal detection using a distantly supervised neural network and develop a metric, {\\Delta}s (or 'delta-softmax'), to quantify signaling strength. Ranging between -1 and 1 and relying on recent advances in contextualized words embeddings, the metric represents each word's positive or negative contribution to the identifiability of a relation in specific instances in context. Based on an English corpus annotated for discourse relations using Rhetorical Structure Theory and signal type annotations anchored to specific tokens, our analysis examines the reliability of the metric, the places where it overlaps with and differs from human judgments, and the implications for identifying features that neural models may need in order to perform better on automatic discourse relation classification.",

  "answer": "Answer with content missing: (Formula) Formula is the answer.",
  "evidence": "Automatic Signal Extraction ::: A Contextualized Neural Model ::: Signaling Metric\n-----\nWe reason that, if a token is important for predicting the correct label, masking it will degrade the model's classification accuracy, or at least reduce its reported classification certainty. In SECREF36, it seems reasonable to assume that masking the word `To' has a greater impact on predicting the label purpose than masking the word `provide', and even less so, the following noun `information'. We therefore use reduction in softmax probability of the correct relation as our signaling strength metric for the model. We call this metric ${\\Delta }_s$ (for delta-softmax), which can be written as:\n\nAutomatic Signal Extraction ::: A Contextualized Neural Model ::: Signaling Metric\n-----\nwhere $rel$ is the true relation of the EDU pair, $t_i$ represents the token at index $i$ of $N$ tokens, and $X_{mask=i}$ represents the input sequence with the masked position $i$ (for $i \\in 1 \\ldots N$ ignoring separators, or $\\phi $, the empty set).\n\n"

  "abstract": "Word embeddings improve the performance of NLP systems by revealing the hidden structural relationships between words. Despite their success in many applications, word embeddings have seen very little use in computational social science NLP tasks, presumably due to their reliance on big data, and to a lack of interpretability. I propose a probabilistic model-based word embedding method which can recover interpretable embeddings, without big data. The key insight is to leverage mixed membership modeling, in which global representations are shared, but individual entities (i.e. dictionary words) are free to use these representations to uniquely differing degrees. I show how to train the model using a combination of state-of-the-art training techniques for word embeddings and topic models. The experimental results show an improvement in predictive language modeling of up to 63% in MRR over the skip-gram, and demonstrate that the representations are beneficial for supervised learning. I illustrate the interpretability of the models with computational social science case studies on State of the Union addresses and NIPS articles.",
  "question": "Why is big data not appropriate for this task?",
  "answer": "Training embeddings from small-corpora can increase the performance of some tasks",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nWord embeddings have risen in popularity for NLP applications due to the success of models designed specifically for the big data setting. In particular, BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 showed that very simple word embedding models with high-dimensional representations can scale up to massive datasets, allowing them to outperform more sophisticated neural network language models which can process fewer documents. In this work, I offer a somewhat contrarian perspective to the currently prevailing trend of big data optimism, as exemplified by the work of BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF3 , and others, who argue that massive datasets are sufficient to allow language models to automatically resolve many challenging NLP tasks. Note that \u201cbig\u201d datasets are not always available, particularly in computational social science NLP applications, where the data of interest are often not obtained from large scale sources such as the internet and social media, but from sources such as press releases BIBREF11 , academic journals BIBREF10 , books BIBREF12 , and transcripts of recorded speech BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 . A standard practice in the literature is to train word embedding models on a generic large corpus such as Wikipedia, and use the embeddings for NLP tasks on the target dataset, cf. BIBREF3 , BIBREF0 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 . However, as we shall see here, this standard practice might not always be effective, as the size of a dataset does not correspond to its degree of relevance for a particular analysis. Even very large corpora have idiosyncrasies that can make their embeddings invalid for other domains. For instance, suppose we would like to use word embeddings to analyze scientific articles on machine learning. In Table TABREF1 , I report the most similar words to the word \u201clearning\u201d based on word embedding models trained on two corpora. For embeddings trained on articles from the NIPS conference, the most similar words are related to machine learning, as desired, while for embeddings trained on the massive, generic Google News corpus, the most similar words relate to learning and teaching in the classroom. Evidently, domain-specific data can be important.\n\nConclusion\n-----\nI have proposed a model-based method for training interpretable corpus-specific word embeddings for computational social science, using mixed membership representations, Metropolis-Hastings-Walker sampling, and NCE. Experimental results for prediction, supervised learning, and case studies on state of the Union addresses and NIPS articles, indicate that high-quality embeddings and topics can be obtained using the method. The results highlight the fact that big data is not always best, as domain-specific data can be very valuable, even when it is small. I plan to use this approach for substantive social science applications, and to address algorithmic bias and fairness issues.\n\n"

  "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach to machine reading comprehension for the MS-MARCO dataset. Unlike the SQuAD dataset that aims to answer a question with exact text spans in a passage, the MS-MARCO dataset defines the task as answering a question from multiple passages and the words in the answer are not necessary in the passages. We therefore develop an extraction-then-synthesis framework to synthesize answers from extraction results. Specifically, the answer extraction model is first employed to predict the most important sub-spans from the passage as evidence, and the answer synthesis model takes the evidence as additional features along with the question and passage to further elaborate the final answers. We build the answer extraction model with state-of-the-art neural networks for single passage reading comprehension, and propose an additional task of passage ranking to help answer extraction in multiple passages. The answer synthesis model is based on the sequence-to-sequence neural networks with extracted evidences as features. Experiments show that our extraction-then-synthesis method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

  "title": "Deep Text-to-Speech System with Seq2Seq Model",
  "abstract": "Recent trends in neural network based text-to-speech/speech synthesis pipelines have employed recurrent Seq2seq architectures that can synthesize realistic sounding speech directly from text characters. These systems however have complex architectures and takes a substantial amount of time to train. We introduce several modifications to these Seq2seq architectures that allow for faster training time, and also allows us to reduce the complexity of the model architecture at the same time. We show that our proposed model can achieve attention alignment much faster than previous architectures and that good audio quality can be achieved with a model that's much smaller in size. Sample audio available at https://soundcloud.com/gary-wang-23/sets/tts-samples-for-cmpt-419.",
  "question": "Which modifications do they make to well-established Seq2seq architectures?",
  "answer": "Replacing attention mechanism to query-key attention, and adding a loss to make the attention mask as diagonal as possible",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nTraditional text-to-speech (TTS) systems are composed of complex pipelines BIBREF0 , these often include accoustic frontends, duration model, acoustic prediction model and vocoder models. The complexity of the TTS problem coupled with the requirement for deep domain expertise means these systems are often brittle in design and results in un-natural synthesized speech.\n\nRelated Work\n-----\nNeural text-to-speech systems have garnered large research interest in the past 2 years. The first to fully explore this avenue of research was Google's tacotron BIBREF1 system. Their architecture based off the original Seq2Seq framework. In addition to encoder/decoder RNNs from the original Seq2Seq , they also included a bottleneck prenet module termed CBHG, which is composed of sets of 1-D convolution networks followed by highway residual layers. The attention mechanism follows the original Seq2Seq BIBREF7 mechanism (often termed Bahdanau attention). This is the first work to propose training a Seq2Seq model to convert text to mel spectrogram, which can then be converted to audio wav via iterative algorithms such as Griffin Lim BIBREF8 .\n\nModel Overview\n-----\nThe architecture of our model utilizes RNN-based Seq2Seq model for generating mel spectrogram from text. The architecture is similar to that of Tacotron 2 BIBREF4 . The generated mel spetrogram can either be inverted via iterative algorithms such as Griffin Lim, or through more complicated neural vocoder networks such as a mel spectrogram conditioned Wavenet BIBREF11 .\n\nChanges to Attention Mechanism\n-----\nIn the original Tacotron 2, the attention mechanism used was location sensitive attention BIBREF12 combined the original additive Seq2Seq BIBREF7 Bahdanau attention.\n\nChanges to Attention Mechanism\n-----\nWe propose to replace this attention with the simpler query-key attention from transformer model. As mentioned earlier, since for TTS the attention mechanism is an easier problem than say machine translation, we employ query-key attention as it's simple to implement and requires less parameters than the original Bahdanau attention.\n\nGuided Attention Mask\n-----\nFollowing the logic above, we utilize a similar method from BIBREF6 that adds an additional guided attention loss to the overall loss objective, which acts to help the attention mechanism become monotoic as early as possible.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Cross-domain sentiment analysis is currently a hot topic in the research and engineering areas.

However, in this work, we find out that applying DIRL may harm domain adaptation when the label distribution $\\rm{P}(\\rm{Y})$ changes across domains. To address this problem, we propose a modification to DIRL, obtaining a novel weighted domain-invariant representation learning (WDIRL) framework. We show that it is easy to transfer existing SOTA DIRL models to WDIRL. Empirical studies on extensive cross-domain sentiment analysis tasks verified our statements and showed the effectiveness of our proposed solution.",

  "abstract": "In this work, we extend the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with an emphasis on directed coattention to obtain an improved F1 performance on the SQUAD2.0 dataset. The Transformer architecture on which BERT is based places hierarchical global attention on the concatenation of the context and query. Our additions to the BERT architecture augment this attention with a more focused context to query (C2Q) and query to context (Q2C) attention via a set of modified Transformer encoder units. In addition, we explore adding convolution-based feature extraction within the coattention architecture to add localized information to self-attention. We found that coattention significantly improves the no answer F1 by 4 points in the base and 1 point in the large architecture. After adding skip connections the no answer F1 improved further without causing an additional loss in has answer F1. The addition of localized feature extraction added to attention produced an overall dev F1 of 77.03 in the base architecture. We applied our findings to the large BERT model which contains twice as many layers and further used our own augmented version of the SQUAD 2.0 dataset created by back translation, which we have named SQUAD 2.Q.

Having the two types of edges lets us distinguish between less reliable edges provided by the coreference system and more reliable (but also more sparse) edges given by the exact-match heuristic. We treat these three types of connections as three different types of relations. See Figure 2 for an illustration.

  "abstract": "We conduct two experiments to study the effect of context on metaphor paraphrase aptness judgments. The first is an AMT crowd source task in which speakers rank metaphor paraphrase candidate sentence pairs in short document contexts for paraphrase aptness. In the second we train a composite DNN to predict these human judgments, first in binary classifier mode, and then as gradient ratings. We found that for both mean human judgments and our DNN's predictions, adding document context compresses the aptness scores towards the center of the scale, raising low out of context ratings and decreasing high out of context scores. We offer a provisional explanation for this compression effect.",
  "question": "What were the results of the first experiment?",
  "answer": "Best performance achieved is 0.72 F1 score",
  "evidence": "MPAT Modelling Results\n-----\nWe also observe that the best combination seems to consist in training our model on the original out-of-context dataset and testing it on the in-context pairs. In this configuration we reach an F-score (0.72) only slightly lower than the one reported in BIBREF3 (0.74), and we record the highest Pearson correlation, 0.3 (which is still not strong, compared to BIBREF3 's best run, 0.75). This result may partly be an artifact of the the larger amount of training data provided by the out-of-context pairs.\n\n"

  "abstract": "As spoken dialogue systems and chatbots are gaining more widespread adoption, commercial and open-sourced services for natural language understanding are emerging. In this paper, we explain how we altered the open-source RASA natural language understanding pipeline to process incrementally (i.e., word-by-word), following the incremental unit framework proposed by Schlangen and Skantze. To do so, we altered existing RASA components to process incrementally, and added an update-incremental intent recognition model as a component to RASA. Our evaluations on the Snips dataset show that our changes allow RASA to function as an effective incremental natural language understanding service.",
  "question": "How are their changes evaluated?",
  "answer": "The changes are evaluated based on accuracy of intent and entity recognition on SNIPS dataset",
  "evidence": "Data, Task, Metrics\n-----\nTo evaluate the performance of our approach, we used a subset of the SNIPS BIBREF12 dataset, which is readily available in RASA nlu format. Our training data consisted of 700 utterances, across 7 different intents (AddToPlaylist, BookRestaurant, GetWeather, PlayMusic, RateBook, SearchCreativeWork, and SearchScreeningEvent). In order to test our implementation of incremental components, we initially benchmarked their non-incremental counterparts, and used that as a baseline for the incremental versions (to treat the sium component as non-incremental, we simply applied all words in each utterance to it and obtained the distribution over intents after each full utterance had been processed).\n\nData, Task, Metrics\n-----\nWe use accuracy of intent and entity recognition as our task and metric. To evaluate the components worked as intended, we then used the IncrementalInterpreter to parse the messages as individual ius. To ensure REVOKE worked as intended, we injected random incorrect words at a rate of 40%, followed by subsequent revokes, ensuring that an ADD followed by a revoke resulted in the same output as if the incorrect word had never been added. While we implemented both an update-incremental and a restart-incremental RASA nlu component, the results of the two cannot be directly compared for accuracy as the underlying models differ greatly (i.e., sium is generative, whereas Tensorflow Embedding is a discriminative neural network; moreover, sium was designed to work as a reference resolution component to physical objects, not abstract intents), nor are these results conducive to an argument of update- vs. restart-incremental approaches, as the underlying architecture of the models vary greatly.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Existing approaches to automatic VerbNet-style verb classification are heavily dependent on feature engineering and therefore limited to languages with mature NLP pipelines. In this work, we propose a novel cross-lingual transfer method for inducing VerbNets for multiple languages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which demonstrates how the architectures for learning word embeddings can be applied to this challenging syntactic-semantic task. Our method uses cross-lingual translation pairs to tie each of the six target languages into a bilingual vector space with English, jointly specialising the representations to encode the relational information from English VerbNet. A standard clustering algorithm is then run on top of the VerbNet-specialised representations, using vector dimensions as features for learning verb classes. Our results show that the proposed cross-lingual transfer approach sets new state-of-the-art verb classification performance across all six target languages explored in this work.",

We also provide an error analysis and suggest areas of work to reduce errors. Our corpus of sentences and judgments are made available.",
  "question": "What is the size of the released dataset?",
  "answer": "440 sentences, 2247 triples extracted from those sentences, and 11262 judgements on those triples.",
  "evidence": "Datasets\n-----\nWe used two different data sources in our evaluation. The first dataset (WIKI) was the same set of 200 sentences from Wikipedia used in BIBREF7 . These sentences were randomly selected by the creators of the dataset. This choice allows for a rough comparison between our results and theirs.\n\nDatasets\n-----\nThe second dataset (SCI) was a set of 220 sentences from the scientific literature. We sourced the sentences from the OA-STM corpus. This corpus is derived from the 10 most published in disciplines. It includes 11 articles each from the following domains: agriculture, astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, earth science, engineering, materials science, math, and medicine. The article text is made freely available and the corpus provides both an XML and a simple text version of each article.\n\nAnnotation Process\n-----\nWe employed the following annotation process. Each OIE extractor was applied to both datasets with the settings described above. This resulted in the generation of triples for 199 of the 200 WIKI sentences and 206 of the 220 SCI sentences. That is there were some sentences in which no triples were extracted. We discuss later the sentences in which no triples were extracted. In total 2247 triples were extracted.\n\nJudgement Data and Inter-Annotator Agreement\n-----\nIn total, 11262 judgements were obtained after running the annotation process. Every triple had at least 5 judgements from different annotators. All judgement data is made available. The proportion of overall agreement between annotators is 0.76 with a standard deviation of 0.25 on whether a triple is consequence of the given sentence. We also calculated inter-annotator agreement statistics. Using Krippendorff's alpha inter-annotator agreement was 0.44. This calculation was performed over all data and annotators as Krippendorff's alpha is designed to account for missing data and work across more than two annotators. Additionally, Fleiss' Kappa and Scott's pi were calculated pairwise between all annotators where there were overlapping ratings (i.e. raters had rated at least one triple in common). The average Fleiss's Kappa was 0.41 and the average of Scott's pi was 0.37. Using BIBREF14 as a guide, we interpret these statistics as suggesting there is moderate agreement between annotators and that agreement is above random chance. This moderate level of agreement is to be expected as the task itself can be difficult and requires judgement from the annotators at the margin.\n\n"

  "question": "Are this models usually semi/supervised or unsupervised?",
  "answer": "Both supervised and unsupervised, depending on the task that needs to be solved.",
  "evidence": "Biochemical Language Processing ::: Text generation ::: Machine Translation\n-----\nMachine translation finds use in cheminformatics in \u201ctranslation\" from one language (e.g. reactants) to another (e.g. products). Machine translation is a challenging task because the syntactic and semantic dependencies of each language differ from one another and this may give rise to ambiguities. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models benefit from the potential of deep learning architectures to build a statistical model that aims to find the most probable target sequence for an input sequence by learning from a corpus of examples BIBREF110, BIBREF111. The main advantage of NMT models is that they provide an end-to-end system that utilizes a single neural network to convert the source sequence into the target sequence. BIBREF110 refer to their model as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) system that addresses a major limitation of DNNs that can only work with fixed-dimensionality information as input and output. However, in the machine translation task, the length of the input sequences is not fixed, and the length of the output sequences is not known in advance.\n\nBiochemical Language Processing ::: Text generation\n-----\nThe variational Auto-encoder (VAE) is another widely adopted text generation architecture BIBREF101. BIBREF34 adopted this architecture for molecule generation. A traditional auto-encoder encodes the input into the latent space, which is then decoded to reconstruct the input. VAE differs from AE by explicitly defining a probability distribution on the latent space to generate new samples. BIBREF34 hypothesized that the variational part of the system integrates noise to the encoder, so that the decoder can be more robust to the large diversity of molecules. However, the authors also reported that the non-context free property of SMILES caused by matching ring numbers and parentheses might often lead the decoder to generate invalid SMILES strings. A grammar variational auto-encoder (GVAE), where the grammar for SMILES is explicitly defined instead of the auto-encoder learning the grammar itself, was proposed to address this issue BIBREF102. This way, the generation is based on the pre-defined grammar rules and the decoding process generates grammar production rules that should also be grammatically valid. Although syntactic validity would be ensured, the molecules may not have semantic validity (chemical validity). BIBREF103 built upon the VAE BIBREF34 and GVAE BIBREF102 architectures and introduced a syntax-directed variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) model for the molecular generation task. The syntax-direct generative mechanism in the decoder contributed to creating both syntactically and semantically valid SMILES sequences. BIBREF103 compared the latent representations of molecules generated by VAE, GVAE, and SD-VAE, and showed that SD-VAE provided better discriminative features for druglikeness. BIBREF104 proposed an adversarial AE for the same task. Conditional VAEs BIBREF105, BIBREF106 were trained to generate molecules conditioned on a desired property. The challenges that SMILES syntax presents inspired the introduction of new syntax such as DeepSMILES BIBREF29 and SELFIES BIBREF32 (details in Section SECREF3).\n\nBiochemical Language Processing ::: Text generation\n-----\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN) models generate novel molecules by using two components: the generator network generates novel molecules, and the discriminator network aims to distinguish between the generated molecules and real molecules BIBREF107. In text generation models, the novel molecules are drawn from a distribution, which are then fine-tuned to obtain specific features, whereas adversarial learning utilizes generator and discriminator networks to produce novel molecules BIBREF107, BIBREF108. ORGAN BIBREF108, a molecular generation methodology, was built upon a sequence generative adversarial network (SeqGAN) from NLP BIBREF109. ORGAN integrated RL in order to generate molecules with desirable properties such as solubility, druglikeness, and synthetizability through using domain-specific rewards BIBREF108.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Word analogy tasks have tended to be handcrafted, involving permutations of hundreds of words with dozens of relations, mostly morphological relations and named entities. Here, we propose modeling commonsense knowledge down to word-level analogical reasoning. We present CA-EHN, the first commonsense word analogy dataset containing 85K analogies covering 5K words and 6K commonsense relations. This was compiled by leveraging E-HowNet, an ontology that annotates 88K Chinese words with their structured sense definitions and English translations. Experiments show that CA-EHN stands out as a great indicator of how well word representations embed commonsense structures, which is crucial for future end-to-end models to generalize inference beyond training corpora. The dataset is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/jacobvsdanniel/CA-EHN}.",

  "abstract": "This paper presents our novel method to encode word confusion networks, which can represent a rich hypothesis space of automatic speech recognition systems, via recurrent neural networks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach for the task of dialog state tracking in spoken dialog systems that relies on automatic speech recognition output. Encoding confusion networks outperforms encoding the best hypothesis of the automatic speech recognition in a neural system for dialog state tracking on the well-known second Dialog State Tracking Challenge dataset.",
  "question": "What is a word confusion network?",
  "answer": "It is a network used to encode speech lattices to maintain a rich hypothesis space.",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nWe take a first step towards integrating ASR in an end-to-end SDS by passing on a richer hypothesis space to subsequent components. Specifically, we investigate how the richer ASR hypothesis space can improve DST. We focus on these two components because they are at the beginning of the processing pipeline and provide vital information for the subsequent SDS components. Typically, ASR systems output the best hypothesis or an n-best list, which the majority of DST approaches so far uses BIBREF11 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF12 . However, n-best lists can only represent a very limited amount of hypotheses. Internally, the ASR system maintains a rich hypothesis space in the form of speech lattices or confusion networks (cnets).\n\n"

  "question": "What baseline algorithms were presented?",
  "answer": "a sentence-level prediction algorithm, a segment retrieval algorithm and a pipeline segment retrieval algorithm",
  "evidence": "Baselines\n-----\nOur video question answering task is novel and to our knowledge, no model has been designed specifically for this task. As a first step towards solving this problem, we evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art models developed for other QA tasks, including a sentence-level prediction task and two segment retrieval tasks. In this section, we report their results on the TutorialVQA dataset.\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline1: Sentence-level prediction\n-----\nGiven a transcript (a sequence of sentences) and a question, Baseline1 predicts (starting sentence index, ending sentence index). The model is based on RaSor BIBREF13, which has been developed for the SQuAD QA task BIBREF6. RaSor concatenates the embedding vectors of the starting and the ending words to represent a span. Following this idea, Baseline1 represents a span of sentences by concatenating the vectors of the starting and ending sentences. The left diagram in Fig. FIGREF15 illustrates the Baseline1 model.\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline1: Sentence-level prediction\n-----\nModel. The model takes two inputs, a transcript, $\\lbrace s_1, s_2, ... s_n\\rbrace $ where $s_i$ are individual sentences and a question, $q$. The output is the span scores, $y$, the scores over all possible spans. GLoVe BIBREF14 is used for the word representations in the transcript and the questions. We use two bi-LSTMs BIBREF15 to encode the transcript.\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline1: Sentence-level prediction\n-----\nwhere n is the number of sentences . The output of Passage-level Encoding, $p$, is a sequence of vector, $p_i$, which represents the latent meaning of each sentence. Then, the model combines each pair of sentence embeddings ($p_i$, $p_j$) to generate a span embedding.\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline1: Sentence-level prediction\n-----\nwhere [$\\cdot $,$\\cdot $] indicates the concatenation. Finally, we use a one-layer feed forward network to compute a score between each span and a question.\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline1: Sentence-level prediction\n-----\nIn training, we use cross-entropy as an objective function. In testing, the span with the highest score is picked as an answer.\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline2: Segment retrieval\n-----\nWe also considered a simpler task by casting our problem as a retrieval task. Specifically, in addition to a plain transcript, we also provided the model with the segmentation information which was created during the data collection phrase (See Section. SECREF3). Note that each segments corresponds to a candidate answer. Then, the task is to pick the best segment for given a query. This task is easier than Baseline1's task in that the segmentation information is provided to the model. Unlike Baseline1, however, it is unable to return an answer span at various granularities. Baseline2 is based on the attentive LSTM BIBREF17, which has been developed for the InsuranceQA task. The right diagram in Fig. FIGREF15 illustrates the Baseline2 model.\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline2: Segment retrieval\n-----\nModel. The two inputs, $s$ and $q$ represent the segment text and a question. The model first encodes the two inputs.\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline2: Segment retrieval\n-----\n$h^s$ is then re-weighted using attention weights.\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline2: Segment retrieval\n-----\nwhere $\\odot $ denotes the element-wise multiplication operation. The final score is computed using a one-layer feed-forward network.\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline2: Segment retrieval\n-----\nDuring training, the model requires negative samples. For each positive example, (question, ground-truth segment), all the other segments in the same transcript are used as negative samples. Cross entropy is used as an objective function.\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline3: Pipeline Segment retrieval\n-----\nWe construct a pipelined approach through another segment retrieval task, calculating the cosine similarities between the segment and question embeddings. In this task however, we want to test the accuracy of retrieving the segments given that we first retrieve the correct video from our 76 videos. First, we generate the TF-IDF embeddings for the whole video transcripts and questions. The next step involves retrieving the videos which have the lowest cosine distance between the video transcripts and question. We then filter and store the top ten videos, reducing the number of computations required in the next step. Finally, we calculate the cosine distances between the question and the segments which belong to the filtered top 10 videos, marking it as correct if found in these videos. While the task is less computationally expensive than the previous baseline, we do not learn the segment representations, as this task is a simple retrieval task based on TF-IDF embeddings.\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline3: Pipeline Segment retrieval\n-----\nModel. The first two inputs are are the question, q, and video transcript, v, encoded by their TF-IDF vectors: BIBREF18:\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline3: Pipeline Segment retrieval\n-----\nWe then filter the top 10 video transcripts(out of 76) with the minimum cosine distance, and further compute the TF-IDF vectors for their segments, Stop10n, where n = 10. We repeat the process for the corresponding segments:\n\nBaselines ::: Baseline3: Pipeline Segment retrieval\n-----\nselecting the segment with the minimal cosine distance distance to the query.\n\n"

Most state-of-the-art neural sequence models do not explicitly capture such structure information, and thus do not perform well on these tasks. In this paper, we propose a new encoder-decoder model based on Tensor Product Representations (TPRs) for Natural- to Formal-language generation, called TP-N2F. The encoder of TP-N2F employs TPR 'binding' to encode natural-language symbolic structure in vector space and the decoder uses TPR 'unbinding' to generate a sequence of relational tuples, each consisting of a relation (or operation) and a number of arguments, in symbolic space. TP-N2F considerably outperforms LSTM-based Seq2Seq models, creating a new state of the art results on two benchmarks: the MathQA dataset for math problem solving, and the AlgoList dataset for program synthesis. Ablation studies show that improvements are mainly attributed to the use of TPRs in both the encoder and decoder to explicitly capture relational structure information for symbolic reasoning.",

The MathQA dataset consists of about 37k math word problems, each with a corresponding list of multi-choice options and the corresponding operation sequence. In this task, TP-N2F is deployed to generate the operation sequence given the question. The generated operations are executed with the execution script from BIBREF16 to select a multi-choice answer. As there are about 30% noisy data (where the execution script returns the wrong answer when given the ground-truth program; see Sec. SECREF20 of the Appendix), we report both execution accuracy (of the final multi-choice answer after running the execution engine) and operation sequence accuracy (where the generated operation sequence must match the ground truth sequence exactly). TP-N2F is compared to a baseline provided by the seq2prog model in BIBREF16, an LSTM-based seq2seq model with attention. Our model outperforms both the original seq2prog, designated SEQ2PROG-orig, and the best reimplemented seq2prog after an extensive hyperparameter search, designated SEQ2PROG-best. Table TABREF16 presents the results. To verify the importance of the TP-N2F encoder and decoder, we conducted experiments to replace either the encoder with a standard LSTM (denoted LSTM2TP) or the decoder with a standard attentional LSTM (denoted TP2LSTM).

  "abstract": "Recently, sentiment analysis has received a lot of attention due to the interest in mining opinions of social media users. Sentiment analysis consists in determining the polarity of a given text, i.e., its degree of positiveness or negativeness. Traditionally, Sentiment Analysis algorithms have been tailored to a specific language given the complexity of having a number of lexical variations and errors introduced by the people generating content. In this contribution, our aim is to provide a simple to implement and easy to use multilingual framework, that can serve as a baseline for sentiment analysis contests, and as starting point to build new sentiment analysis systems. We compare our approach in eight different languages, three of them have important international contests, namely, SemEval (English), TASS (Spanish), and SENTIPOLC (Italian). Within the competitions our approach reaches from medium to high positions in the rankings; whereas in the remaining languages our approach outperforms the reported results.",

  "answer": "Arabic, German, Portuguese, Russian, Swedish",
  "evidence": "Performance on sentiment analysis contests\n-----\nIn BIBREF3 , BIBREF2 , the authors study the effect of translation in sentiment classifiers; they found better to use native Arabic speakers as annotators than fine-tuned translators plus fine-tuned English sentiment classifiers. In BIBREF21 , the idea is to measure the effect of the agreement among annotators on the production of a sentiment-analysis corpus. Both, on the technical side, both papers use fine tuned classifiers plus a variety of pre-processing techniques to prove their claims. Table TABREF24 supports the idea of choosing B4MSA as a bootstrapping sentiment classifier because, in the overall, B4MSA reaches superior performances regardless of the language. Our approach achieves those performance's levels since it optimizes a set of parameters carefully selected to work on a variety of languages and being robust to informal writing. The latter problem is not properly tackled in many cases.\n\n"

  "answer": "Proposing an improved RNN model, the phonetic temporal neural LID approach, based on phonetic features that results in better performance",
  "evidence": "Motivation of the paper\n-----\nAll the present neural LID methods are based on acoustic features, e.g., Mel filter banks (Fbanks) or Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), with phonetic information largely overlooked. This may have significantly hindered the performance of neural LID. Intuitively, it is a long-standing hypothesis that languages can be discriminated between by phonetic properties, either distributional or temporal; additionally, phonetic features represent information at a higher level than acoustic features, and so are more invariant with respect to noise and channels. Pragmatically, it has been demonstrated that phonetic information, either in the form of phone sequences, phone posteriors, or phonetic bottleneck features, can significantly improve LID accuracy in both the conventional PRLM approach BIBREF11 and the more modern i-vector system BIBREF34 , BIBREF35 , BIBREF36 . In this paper, we will investigate the utilization of phonetic information to improve neural LID. The basic concept is to use a phone-discriminative model to produce frame-level phonetic features, and then use these features to enhance RNN LID systems that were originally built with raw acoustic features. The initial step is therefore feature combination, with the phonetic feature used as auxiliary information to assist acoustic RNN LID. This is improved further, as additional research identified that a simpler model using only the phonetic feature as the RNN LID input provides even better performance. We call this RNN model based on phonetic features the phonetic temporal neural LID approach, or PTN LID. As well as having a simplified model structure, the PTN offers deeper insight into the LID task by rediscovering the value of the phonetic temporal property in language discrimination. This property was historically widely and successfully applied in token-based approaches, e.g., PRLM BIBREF11 , but has been largely overlooked due to the popularity of the i-vector approach.\n\n"

  "title": "Representation Learning for Discovering Phonemic Tone Contours",
  "abstract": "Tone is a prosodic feature used to distinguish words in many languages, some of which are endangered and scarcely documented. In this work, we use unsupervised representation learning to identify probable clusters of syllables that share the same phonemic tone. Our method extracts the pitch for each syllable, then trains a convolutional autoencoder to learn a low dimensional representation for each contour. We then apply the mean shift algorithm to cluster tones in high-density regions of the latent space. Furthermore, by feeding the centers of each cluster into the decoder, we produce a prototypical contour that represents each cluster. We apply this method to spoken multi-syllable words in Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese and evaluate how closely our clusters match the ground truth tone categories. Finally, we discuss some difficulties with our approach, including contextual tone variation and allophony effects.",
  "question": "How close do clusters match to ground truth tone categories?",
  "answer": "NMI between cluster assignments and ground truth tones for all sylables is:\nMandarin: 0.641\nCantonese: 0.464",
  "evidence": "Results\n-----\nTo test this hypothesis, we evaluate the model on only the first syllable of every word, which eliminates carry-over and declination effects (Table TABREF14). In both Mandarin and Cantonese, the clustering is more accurate when using only the first syllables, compared to using all of the syllables.\n\n"

  "title": "Robust Multilingual Named Entity Recognition with Shallow Semi-Supervised Features",
  "abstract": "We present a multilingual Named Entity Recognition approach based on a robust and general set of features across languages and datasets. Our system combines shallow local information with clustering semi-supervised features induced on large amounts of unlabeled text. Understanding via empirical experimentation how to effectively combine various types of clustering features allows us to seamlessly export our system to other datasets and languages. The result is a simple but highly competitive system which obtains state of the art results across five languages and twelve datasets. The results are reported on standard shared task evaluation data such as CoNLL for English, Spanish and Dutch. Furthermore, and despite the lack of linguistically motivated features, we also report best results for languages such as Basque and German. In addition, we demonstrate that our method also obtains very competitive results even when the amount of supervised data is cut by half, alleviating the dependency on manually annotated data. Finally, the results show that our emphasis on clustering features is crucial to develop robust out-of-domain models.

They are rewarded $0.04 per task. We use two strategies to control the quality of the human evaluation. First, we require the turkers to have a HIT approval rate of 90% or above. Second, we insert some quality checkpoints by asking the turkers to compare two summaries of same text content but in different sentence orders. Turkers who did not pass these tests are filtered out.

In the following experiments, summary length is set to be the average number of words in human summaries or less. For the matrix completion algorithm, we perform grid search (on a scale of [0, 5] with stepsize 0.5) to tune the hyper-parameter INLINEFORM0 (Eq.

Therefore, H1.a holds. For H1.b, we only observe INLINEFORM1 significantly on Stat2016 and there is no significant difference between INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 on the other two courses. First, the gold-standard data set is still small in the sense that only a limited portion of bigrams in the entire data set are evaluated. Second, the assumption that phrases annotated by different colors are not necessarily unrelated is too strong. For example, \u201chypothesis testing\" and \u201cH1 and Ho conditions\" are in different colors in the example of Table TABREF15 , but one is a subtopic of the other. An alternative way to evaluate the hypothesis is to let humans judge whether two bigrams are similar or not, which we leave for future work. Third, the gold standards are pairs of semantically similar bigrams, while matrix completion captures bigrams that occurs in a similar context, which is not necessarily equivalent to semantic similarity. For example, the sentence \u201cgraphs make it easier to understand concepts\" in Table TABREF25 is associated with \u201chard to\".\n\n"

  "answer": "EER 16.04, Cmindet 0.6012, Cdet 0.6107",
  "evidence": "Results and Discussion\n-----\nIn this section we present the results obtained on the protocol provided by NIST on the development set which is supposed to mirror that of evaluation set. The results are shown in Table TABREF26 . The first part of the table indicates the result obtained by the primary system. As can be seen, the fusion of MFCC and PLP (a simple sum of both MFCC and PLP scores) resulted in a relative improvement of almost 10%, as compared to MFCC alone, in terms of both INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 . In order to quantify the contribution of the different system components we have defined different scenarios. In scenario A, we have analysed the effect of using LDA instead of NDA. As can be seen from the results, LDA outperforms NDA in the case of PLP, however, in fusion we can see that NDA resulted in better performance in terms of the primary metric. In scenario B, we analysed the effect of using the short-duration compensation technique proposed in Section SECREF7 . Results indicate superior performance using this technique. In scenario C, we investigated the effects of language normalization on the performance of the system. If we replace LN-LDA with simple LDA, we can see performance degradation in MFCC as well as fusion, however, PLP seems not to be adversely affected. The effect of using QMF is also investigated in scenario D. Finally in scenario E, we can see the major improvement obtained through the use of the domain adaptation technique explained in Section SECREF16 . For our secondary submission, we incorporated a disjoint portion of the labelled development set (10 out of 20 speakers) in either LN-LDA and in-domain PLDA training. We evaluated the system on almost 6k out of 24k trials from the other portion to avoid any over-fitting, particularly important for the domain adaptation technique. This resulted in a relative improvement of 11% compared to the primary system in terms of the primary metric. However, the results can be misleading, since the recording condition may be the same for all speakers in the development set.\n\n"

  "title": "Event detection in Twitter: A keyword volume approach",
  "abstract": "Event detection using social media streams needs a set of informative features with strong signals that need minimal preprocessing and are highly associated with events of interest. Identifying these informative features as keywords from Twitter is challenging, as people use informal language to express their thoughts and feelings. This informality includes acronyms, misspelled words, synonyms, transliteration and ambiguous terms. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to select the keywords frequently used in Twitter that are mostly associated with events of interest such as protests. The volume of these keywords is tracked in real time to identify the events of interest in a binary classification scheme. We use keywords within word-pairs to capture the context. The proposed method is to binarize vectors of daily counts for each word-pair by applying a spike detection temporal filter, then use the Jaccard metric to measure the similarity of the binary vector for each word-pair with the binary vector describing event occurrence. The top n word-pairs are used as features to classify any day to be an event or non-event day. The selected features are tested using multiple classifiers such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN and decision trees. They all produced AUC ROC scores up to 0.91 and F1 scores up to 0.79. The experiment is performed using the English language in multiple cities such as Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane as well as the Indonesian language in Jakarta. The two experiments, comprising different languages and locations, yielded similar results.",
  "question": "How are the keywords associated with events such as protests selected?",
  "answer": "By using a Bayesian approach  and by using word-pairs, where they extract all the pairs of co-occurring words within each tweet.  They search for the words that achieve the highest number of spikes matching the days of events.",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nWe approached the first and second challenges by using a Bayesian approach to learn which terms were associated with events, regardless of whether they are standard language, acronyms, or even a made-up word, so long as they match the events of interest. The third and fourth challenges are approached by using word-pairs, where we extract all the pairs of co-occurring words within each tweet. This allows us to recognize the context of the word ('Messi','strike' ) is different than ('labour','strike').\n\nIntroduction\n-----\nAccording to the distributional semantic hypothesis, event-related words are likely to be used on the day of an event more frequently than any normal day before or after the event. This will form a spike in the keyword count magnitude along the timeline as illustrated in Figure FIGREF6 . To find the words most associated with events, we search for the words that achieve the highest number of spikes matching the days of events. We use the Jaccard similarity metric as it values the spikes matching events and penalizes spikes with no event and penalizes events without spikes. Separate words can be noisy due to the misuse of the term by people, especially in big data environments. So, we rather used the word-pairs as textual features in order to capture the context of the word. For example, this can differentiate between the multiple usages of the word \u201cstrike\u201d within the contexts of \u201clightning strike\u201d, \u201cfootball strike\u201d and \u201clabour strike\u201d\n\n"

We also propose to evaluate the model-level quality of NLG models with sample-level comparison results with skill rating system. While able to be trained in a fully self-supervised fashion, our model can be further fine-tuned with a little amount of human preference annotation to better imitate human judgment. In addition to evaluating trained models, we propose to apply our model as a performance indicator during training for better hyperparameter tuning and early-stopping.

In addition, we find that evaluating generated samples by comparing it with a set of randomly selected samples or using sample-level skill rating performs almost equally well. This is not surprising as the employed skill rating is able to handle the inherent variance of players (i.e. NLG models).

Thus, we started a project of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for the Ainu language in order to contribute to the development of annotated language archives. In this paper, we report speech corpus development and the structure and performance of end-to-end ASR for Ainu. We investigated four modeling units (phone, syllable, word piece, and word) and found that the syllable-based model performed best in terms of both word and phone recognition accuracy, which were about 60% and over 85% respectively in speaker-open condition. Furthermore, word and phone accuracy of 80% and 90% has been achieved in a speaker-closed setting. We also found out that a multilingual ASR training with additional speech corpora of English and Japanese further improves the speaker-open test accuracy.",

  "title": "Revealing the Importance of Semantic Retrieval for Machine Reading at Scale",
  "abstract": "Machine Reading at Scale (MRS) is a challenging task in which a system is given an input query and is asked to produce a precise output by \"reading\" information from a large knowledge base. The task has gained popularity with its natural combination of information retrieval (IR) and machine comprehension (MC). Advancements in representation learning have led to separated progress in both IR and MC; however, very few studies have examined the relationship and combined design of retrieval and comprehension at different levels of granularity, for development of MRS systems. In this work, we give general guidelines on system design for MRS by proposing a simple yet effective pipeline system with special consideration on hierarchical semantic retrieval at both paragraph and sentence level, and their potential effects on the downstream task. The system is evaluated on both fact verification and open-domain multihop QA, achieving state-of-the-art results on the leaderboard test sets of both FEVER and HOTPOTQA. To further demonstrate the importance of semantic retrieval, we present ablation and analysis studies to quantify the contribution of neural retrieval modules at both paragraph-level and sentence-level, and illustrate that intermediate semantic retrieval modules are vital for not only effectively filtering upstream information and thus saving downstream computation, but also for shaping upstream data distribution and providing better data for downstream modeling.

More specifically, the biggest improvement comes from the EM for the supporting fact which in turn leads to doubling of the joint EM on previous best results. The scores for answer predictions are also higher than all previous best results with $\\sim $8 absolute points increase on EM and $\\sim $9 absolute points on F1. All the improvements are consistent between test and dev set evaluation.\n\nResults on Benchmarks\n-----\nSimilarly for FEVER, we showed F1 for evidence, the Label Accuracy, and the FEVER Score (same as benchmark evaluation) for models in Table TABREF9. Our system obtained substantially higher scores than all previously published results with a $\\sim $4 and $\\sim $3 points absolute improvement on Label Accuracy and FEVER Score.

  "question": "What is a string kernel?",
  "answer": "String kernel is a technique that uses character n-grams to measure the similarity of strings",
  "evidence": "String Kernels\n-----\nIn recent years, methods based on string kernels have demonstrated remarkable performance in various text classification tasks BIBREF35 , BIBREF36 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF26 . String kernels represent a way of using information at the character level by measuring the similarity of strings through character n-grams. Lodhi et al. BIBREF35 used string kernels for document categorization, obtaining very good results. String kernels were also successfully used in authorship identification BIBREF22 . More recently, various combinations of string kernels reached state-of-the-art accuracy rates in native language identification BIBREF19 and Arabic dialect identification BIBREF17 . Interestingly, string kernels have been used in cross-domain settings without any domain adaptation, obtaining impressive results. For instance, Ionescu et al. BIBREF19 have employed string kernels in a cross-corpus (and implicitly cross-domain) native language identification experiment, improving the state-of-the-art accuracy by a remarkable INLINEFORM0 . Gim\u00e9nez-P\u00e9rez et al. BIBREF10 have used string kernels for single-source and multi-source polarity classification. Remarkably, they obtain state-of-the-art performance without using knowledge from the target domain, which indicates that string kernels provide robust results in the cross-domain setting without any domain adaptation. Ionescu et al. BIBREF17 obtained the best performance in the Arabic Dialect Identification Shared Task of the 2017 VarDial Evaluation Campaign BIBREF37 , with an improvement of INLINEFORM1 over the second-best method. It is important to note that the training and the test speech samples prepared for the shared task were recorded in different setups BIBREF37 , or in other words, the training and the test sets are drawn from different distributions. Different from all these recent approaches BIBREF19 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF17 , we use unlabeled data from the target domain to significantly increase the performance of string kernels in cross-domain text classification, particularly in English polarity classification.\n\n"

  "title": "Towards an Unsupervised Entrainment Distance in Conversational Speech using Deep Neural Networks",
  "abstract": "Entrainment is a known adaptation mechanism that causes interaction participants to adapt or synchronize their acoustic characteristics. Understanding how interlocutors tend to adapt to each other's speaking style through entrainment involves measuring a range of acoustic features and comparing those via multiple signal comparison methods. In this work, we present a turn-level distance measure obtained in an unsupervised manner using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, which we call Neural Entrainment Distance (NED). This metric establishes a framework that learns an embedding from the population-wide entrainment in an unlabeled training corpus. We use the framework for a set of acoustic features and validate the measure experimentally by showing its efficacy in distinguishing real conversations from fake ones created by randomly shuffling speaker turns. Moreover, we show real world evidence of the validity of the proposed measure. We find that high value of NED is associated with high ratings of emotional bond in suicide assessment interviews, which is consistent with prior studies.",
  "question": "How do they correlate NED with emotional bond levels?",
  "answer": "They compute Pearson\u2019s correlation between NED measure for patient-to-therapist and patient-perceived emotional bond rating and NED measure for therapist-to-patient and patient-perceived emotional bond rating",
  "evidence": "Experiment 2: Correlation with Emotional Bond\n-----\nAccording to prior work, both from domain theory BIBREF16 and from experimental validation BIBREF6 , a high emotional bond in patient-therapist interactions in the suicide therapy domain is associated with more entrainment. In this experiment, we compute the correlation of the proposed NED measure with the patient-perceived emotional bond ratings. Since the proposed measure is asymmetric in nature, we compute the measures for both patient-to-therapist and therapist-to-patient entrainment. We also compute the correlation of emotional bond with the baselines used in Experiment 1. We report Pearson's correlation coefficients ( INLINEFORM0 ) for this experiment in Table TABREF26 along with their INLINEFORM1 -values. We test against the null hypothesis INLINEFORM2 that there is no linear association between emotional bond and the candidate measure.\n\n"

  "abstract": "We introduce a novel sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) voice conversion (VC) model based on the Transformer architecture with text-to-speech (TTS) pretraining. Seq2seq VC models are attractive owing to their ability to convert prosody. While seq2seq models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to VC, the use of the Transformer network, which has shown promising results in various speech processing tasks, has not yet been investigated. Nonetheless, their data-hungry property and the mispronunciation of converted speech make seq2seq models far from practical. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective pretraining technique to transfer knowledge from learned TTS models, which benefit from large-scale, easily accessible TTS corpora. VC models initialized with such pretrained model parameters are able to generate effective hidden representations for high-fidelity, highly intelligible converted speech. Experimental results show that such a pretraining scheme can facilitate data-efficient training and outperform an RNN-based seq2seq VC model in terms of intelligibility, naturalness, and similarity.",

The policy engine and language generation tasks are modeled jointly following that. The copy-augmented sequential decoder deals with new or unknown values in the conversation, while the multi-label decoder combined with the sequential decoder ensures the explicit assignment of values to slots.

  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nThis paper proposes the Flexibly-Structured Dialogue Model (FSDM) as a new end-to-end task-oriented dialogue system. The state tracking component of FSDM has the advantages of both fully structured and free-form approaches while addressing their shortcomings. On one hand, it is still structured, as it incorporates information about slots in KB schema; on the other hand, it is flexible, as it does not use information about the values contained in the KB records. This makes it easily adaptable to new values. These desirable properties are achieved by a separate decoder for each informable slot and a multi-label classifier for the requestable slots. Those components explicitly assign values to slots like the fully structured approach, while also preserving the capability of dealing with out-of-vocabulary words like the free-form approach. By using these two types of decoders, FSDM produces only valid belief states, overcoming the limitations of the free-form approach. Further, FSDM has a new module called response slot binary classifier that adds extra supervision to generate the slots that will be present in the response more precisely before generating the final textual agent response (see Section \"Methodology\" for details).\n\n"

  "title": "Evaluating the Performance of a Speech Recognition based System",
  "abstract": "Speech based solutions have taken center stage with growth in the services industry where there is a need to cater to a very large number of people from all strata of the society. While natural language speech interfaces are the talk in the research community, yet in practice, menu based speech solutions thrive. Typically in a menu based speech solution the user is required to respond by speaking from a closed set of words when prompted by the system. A sequence of human speech response to the IVR prompts results in the completion of a transaction. A transaction is deemed successful if the speech solution can correctly recognize all the spoken utterances of the user whenever prompted by the system. The usual mechanism to evaluate the performance of a speech solution is to do an extensive test of the system by putting it to actual people use and then evaluating the performance by analyzing the logs for successful transactions. This kind of evaluation could lead to dissatisfied test users especially if the performance of the system were to result in a poor transaction completion rate. To negate this the Wizard of Oz approach is adopted during evaluation of a speech system. Overall this kind of evaluations is an expensive proposition both in terms of time and cost. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate the performance of a speech solution without actually putting it to people use. We first describe the methodology and then show experimentally that this can be used to identify the performance bottlenecks of the speech solution even before the system is actually used thus saving evaluation time and expenses.",
  "question": "what bottlenecks were identified?",
  "answer": "Confusion in recognizing the words that are active at a given node by a speech recognition solution developed for Indian Railway Inquiry System.",
  "evidence": "Conclusion\n-----\nIn this paper we proposed a methodology to identify words that could lead to confusion at any given node of a speech recognition based system. We used edit distance as the metric to identifying the possible confusion between the active words. We showed that this metric can be used effectively to enhance the performance of a speech solution without actually putting it to people test. There is a significant saving in terms of being able to identify recognition bottlenecks in a menu based speech solution through this analysis because it does not require actual people testing the system. This methodology was adopted to restructuring the set of active words at each node for better speech recognition in an actual menu based speech recognition system that caters to masses.\n\nEvaluation without Testing\n-----\nWe hypothesize that we can identify the performance of a menu based speech system by identifying the possible confusion among all the words that are active at a given node. If active words at a given node are phonetically similar it becomes difficult for the speech recognition system to distinguish them which in turn leads to recognition errors. We used Levenshtein distance BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 a well known measure to analyze and identify the confusion among the active words at a given node. This analysis gives a list of all set of words that have a high degree of confusability among them; this understanding can be then used to (a) restructure the set of active words at that node and/or (b) train the words that can be confused by using a larger corpus of speech data. This allows the speech recognition engine to be equipped to be able to distinguish the confusing words better. Actual use of this analysis was carried out for a speech solution developed for Indian Railway Inquiry System to identify bottlenecks in the system before its actual launch.\n\n"

Also, the type of microphone depends on the equipment of the school. On average, the audio signal quality is nearly good, while the main problem is caused by a high percentage of extraneous speech. This is due to the fact that organisers decided to use a fixed duration - which depends on the question - for recording spoken utterances, so that all the recordings for a given question have the same length. However, while it is rare that a speaker has not enough time to answer, it is quite common that, especially after the end of the utterance, some other speech (e.g. comments, jokes with mates, indications from the teachers, etc.) is captured. In addition, background noise is often present due to several sources (doors, steps, keyboard typing, background voices, street noises if the windows are open, etc). Finally, it has to be pointed out that many answers are whispered and difficult to understand.\n\n"

BIBREF2 propose a neural attention model with a convolutional encoder to solve this task.

More recently, BIBREF4 extended BIBREF2 's work with an RNN decoder, and BIBREF8 proposed an RNN encoder-decoder architecture for summarization. Both techniques are currently the state-of-the-art on the DUC competition. However, the encoders exploited in these methods lack the ability to encode each word condition on the whole text, as an RNN encodes a word into a hidden vector by taking into account only the words up to that time step. In contrast, in this work we propose a `Read-Again' encoder-decoder architecture, which enables the encoder to understand each input word after reading the whole sentence. Our encoder first reads the text, and the results from the first read help represent the text in the second pass over the source text. Our second contribution is a simple copy mechanism that allows us to significantly reduce the decoder vocabulary size resulting in much faster inference times. Furthermore our copy mechanism allows us to handle out-of-vocabulary words in a principled manner. Finally our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on the DUC competition.\n\n"

  "title": "Compressing BERT: Studying the Effects of Weight Pruning on Transfer Learning",
  "abstract": "Universal feature extractors, such as BERT for natural language processing and VGG for computer vision, have become effective methods for improving deep learning models without requiring more labeled data. A common paradigm is to pre-train a feature extractor on large amounts of data then fine-tune it as part of a deep learning model on some downstream task (i.e. transfer learning). While effective, feature extractors like BERT may be prohibitively large for some deployment scenarios. We explore weight pruning for BERT and ask: how does compression during pre-training affect transfer learning? We find that pruning affects transfer learning in three broad regimes. Low levels of pruning (30-40\\%) do not affect pre-training loss or transfer to downstream tasks at all. Medium levels of pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful pre-training information from being transferred to downstream tasks. High levels of pruning additionally prevent models from fitting downstream datasets, leading to further degradation. Finally, we observe that fine-tuning BERT on a specific task does not improve its prunability. We conclude that BERT can be pruned once during pre-training rather than separately for each task without affecting performance.",
  "question": "How much is pre-training loss increased in Low/Medium/Hard level of pruning?",
  "answer": "The increase is linearly from lowest on average 2.0 , medium around 3.5, and the largest is 6.0",

Similarly, the performance of information-deletion models is a proxy for how much of that information was useful for each task. Figure FIGREF18 shows that the pre-training loss linearly predicts the effects of information deletion on downstream accuracy.\n\n"

If we only consider LMS which broadcasts with a single channel, the average number of chats are 7210 with standard deviation of 2719.

  "abstract": "Standard methods in deep learning for natural language processing fail to capture the compositional structure of human language that allows for systematic generalization outside of the training distribution. However, human learners readily generalize in this way, e.g. by applying known grammatical rules to novel words. Inspired by work in neuroscience suggesting separate brain systems for syntactic and semantic processing, we implement a modification to standard approaches in neural machine translation, imposing an analogous separation. The novel model, which we call Syntactic Attention, substantially outperforms standard methods in deep learning on the SCAN dataset, a compositional generalization task, without any hand-engineered features or additional supervision. Our work suggests that separating syntactic from semantic learning may be a useful heuristic for capturing compositional structure.",

Success on this difficult problem requires models to generalize knowledge gained about the other primitive verbs (\"walk\", \"run\" and \"look\") to the novel verb \"jump,\" without having seen \"jump\" in any but the most basic context (\"jump\" $\\rightarrow $ JUMP). It is trivial for human learners to generalize in this way (e.g. if I tell you that \"dax\" is a verb, you can generalize its usage to all kinds of constructions, like \"dax twice and then dax again\", without even knowing what the word means) BIBREF2 . However, standard recurrent seq2seq models fail miserably on this task, with the best-reported model (a gated recurrent unit augmented with an attention mechanism) achieving only 12.5% accuracy on the test set BIBREF2 , BIBREF4 .

  "title": "Non-native Speaker Verification for Spoken Language Assessment",
  "abstract": "Automatic spoken language assessment systems are becoming more popular in order to handle increasing interests in second language learning. One challenge for these systems is to detect malpractice. Malpractice can take a range of forms, this paper focuses on detecting when a candidate attempts to impersonate another in a speaking test. This form of malpractice is closely related to speaker verification, but applied in the specific domain of spoken language assessment. Advanced speaker verification systems, which leverage deep-learning approaches to extract speaker representations, have been successfully applied to a range of native speaker verification tasks. These systems are explored for non-native spoken English data in this paper. The data used for speaker enrolment and verification is mainly taken from the BULATS test, which assesses English language skills for business. Performance of systems trained on relatively limited amounts of BULATS data, and standard large speaker verification corpora, is compared. Experimental results on large-scale test sets with millions of trials show that the best performance is achieved by adapting the imported model to non-native data. Breakdown of impostor trials across different first languages (L1s) and grades is analysed, which shows that inter-L1 impostors are more challenging for speaker verification systems.",

In this paper, the Kaldi-released BIBREF19 VoxCeleb x-vector/PLDA system was used as imported models, which was trained on augmented VoxCeleb 1 BIBREF17 and VoxCeleb 2 BIBREF18. There are more than 7,000 speakers in the VoxCeleb dataset with more than 2,000 hours of audio data, making it the largest publicly available speaker recognition dataset. 30 dimensional mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as input features and system configurations were the same as the BULATS x-vector/PLDA one. It can be seen from Table TABREF10 that these out-of-domain models gave worse performance than baseline systems trained on a far smaller amount of BULATS data due to domain mismatch. Thus, two kinds of in-domain adaptation strategies were explored to make use of the BULATS training set: PLDA adaptation and x-vector extractor fine-tuning. For PLDA adaptation, x-vectors of the BULATS training set were first extracted using the VoxCeleb-trained x-vector extractor, and then employed to adapt the VoxCeleb-trained PLDA model with their mean and variance. For x-vector extractor fine-tuning, with all other layers of the VoxCeleb-trained model kept still, the output layer was re-initialised using the BULATS training set with the number of targets adjusted accordingly, and then all layers were fine-tuned on the BULATS training set. Here the PLDA adaptation system is referred to as X1 and the extractor fine-tuning system is referred to as X2. Both adaptation approaches can yield good performance gains as can be seen from Table TABREF10. PLDA adaptation is a straightforward yet effective way, while the system with x-vector extractor fine-tuning gave slightly lower EERs on both BULATS and Linguaskill test sets by virtue of a relatively \u201cin-domain\" extractor prior to the PLDA back-end.\n\n"

  "abstract": "We describe a question answering model that applies to both images and structured knowledge bases. The model uses natural language strings to automatically assemble neural networks from a collection of composable modules. Parameters for these modules are learned jointly with network-assembly parameters via reinforcement learning, with only (world, question, answer) triples as supervision. Our approach, which we term a dynamic neural model network, achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets in both visual and structured domains.",
  "question": "What benchmark datasets they use?",
  "answer": "VQA and GeoQA",
  "evidence": "Questions about images\n-----\nOur first task is the recently-introduced Visual Question Answering challenge (VQA) BIBREF22 . The VQA dataset consists of more than 200,000 images paired with human-annotated questions and answers, as in fig:vqa:qualitative-results.\n\nQuestions about geography\n-----\nThe next set of experiments we consider focuses on GeoQA, a geographical question-answering task first introduced by Krish2013Grounded. This task was originally paired with a visual question answering task much simpler than the one just discussed, and is appealing for a number of reasons. In contrast to the VQA dataset, GeoQA is quite small, containing only 263 examples. Two baselines are available: one using a classical semantic parser backed by a database, and another which induces logical predicates using linear classifiers over both spatial and distributional features. This allows us to evaluate the quality of our model relative to other perceptually grounded logical semantics, as well as strictly logical approaches.\n\n"

  "question": "How do they combine MonaLog with BERT?",
  "answer": "They use Monalog for data-augmentation to fine-tune BERT on this task",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nIn this work, we introduce a new logical inference engine called MonaLog, which is based on natural logic and work on monotonicity stemming from vanBenthemEssays86. In contrast to the logical approaches cited above, our starting point is different in that we begin with the following two questions: 1) what is the simplest logical system that one can come up with to solve empirical NLI problems (i.e., the system with minimal amounts of primitives and background knowledge)?; and 2) what is the lower-bound performance of such a model? Like other approaches to natural logic BIBREF15, BIBREF16, our model works by reasoning over surface forms (as opposed to translating to symbolic representations) using a small inventory of monotonicity facts about quantifiers, lexical items and token-level polarity BIBREF17; proofs in the calculus are hence fully interpretable and expressible in ordinary language. Unlike existing work on natural logic, however, our model avoids the need for having expensive alignment and search sub-procedures BIBREF18, BIBREF19, and relies on a much smaller set of background knowledge and primitive relations than MacCartneyManning.\n\nIntroduction\n-----\nSince our logic operates over surface forms, it is straightforward to hybridize our models. We investigate using MonaLog in combination with the language model BERT BIBREF20, including for compositional data augmentation, i.e, re-generating entailed versions of examples in our training sets. To our knowledge, our approach is the first attempt to use monotonicity for data augmentation, and we show that such augmentation can generate high-quality training data with which models like BERT can improve performance.\n\nMonaLog and SICK\n-----\nWe perform two experiments to test MonaLog. We first use MonaLog to solve the problems in a commonly used natural language inference dataset, SICK BIBREF1, comparing our results with previous systems. Second, we test the quality of the data generated by MonaLog. To do this, we generate more training data (sentence pairs) from the SICK training data using our system, and performe fine-tuning on BERT BIBREF20, a language model based on the transformer architecture BIBREF23, with the expanded dataset. In all experiments, we use the Base, Uncased model of BERT.\n\n"

Such world knowledge can be created manually for the problem at hand, or derived easily from existing resources such as WordNet BIBREF22. Note that we do not blindly add all relations from WordNet to our knowledge base, since this would hinge heavily on word sense disambiguation (we need to know whether the \u201cbank\u201d is a financial institution or a river bank to extract its relations correctly). In the current implementation, we avoid this by adding x $\\le $ y or x $\\perp $ y relations only if both x and y are words in the premise-hypothesis pair. Additionally, some relations that involve quantifiers and prepositions need to be hard-coded, since WordNet does not include them: every $=$ all $=$ each $\\le $ most $\\le $ many $\\le $ a few $=$ several $\\le $ some $=$ a; the $\\le $ some $=$ a; on $\\perp $ off; up $\\perp $ down; etc.\n\n"

Automatic LI has been extensively researched for over fifty years. Today, LI is a key part of many text processing pipelines, as text processing techniques generally assume that the language of the input text is known. Research in this area has recently been especially active. This article provides a brief history of LI research, and an extensive survey of the features and methods used so far in the LI literature. For describing the features and methods we introduce a unified notation. We discuss evaluation methods, applications of LI, as well as off-the-shelf LI systems that do not require training by the end user. Finally, we identify open issues, survey the work to date on each issue, and propose future directions for research in LI.",

TextCat is not the only example of an off-the-shelf implementation of the out-of-place method: other implementations include libtextcat with 76 language models, JTCL with 15 languages, and mguesser with 104 models for different language-encoding pairs. The main issue addressed by later implementations is classification speed: TextCat is implemented in Perl and is not optimized for speed, whereas implementations such as libtextcat and mguesser have been specifically written to be fast and efficient. whatlang-rs uses an algorithm based on character trigrams and refers the user to the BIBREF7 article. It comes pre-trained with 83 languages.\n\nOff-the-Shelf Language Identifiers\n-----\nis the language identifier embedded in the Google Chrome web browser.

  "title": "Neural Semantic Parsing in Low-Resource Settings with Back-Translation and Meta-Learning",
  "abstract": "Neural semantic parsing has achieved impressive results in recent years, yet its success relies on the availability of large amounts of supervised data. Our goal is to learn a neural semantic parser when only prior knowledge about a limited number of simple rules is available, without access to either annotated programs or execution results. Our approach is initialized by rules, and improved in a back-translation paradigm using generated question-program pairs from the semantic parser and the question generator. A phrase table with frequent mapping patterns is automatically derived, also updated as training progresses, to measure the quality of generated instances. We train the model with model-agnostic meta-learning to guarantee the accuracy and stability on examples covered by rules, and meanwhile acquire the versatility to generalize well on examples uncovered by rules. Results on three benchmark datasets with different domains and programs show that our approach incrementally improves the accuracy. On WikiSQL, our best model is comparable to the SOTA system learned from denotations.",
  "question": "How many rules had to be defined?",
  "answer": "WikiSQL - 2 rules (SELECT, WHERE)\nSimpleQuestions - 1 rule\nSequentialQA - 3 rules (SELECT, WHERE, COPY)",
  "evidence": "Table-Based Semantic Parsing\n-----\nWe describe our rules for WikiSQL here. We first detect WHERE values, which exactly match to table cells. After that, if a cell appears at more than one column, we choose the column name with more overlapped words with the question, with a constraint that the number of co-occurred words is larger than 1. By default, a WHERE operator is INLINEFORM0 , except for the case that surrounding words of a value contain keywords for INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 . Then, we deal with the SELECT column, which has the largest number of co-occurred words and cannot be same with any WHERE column. By default, the SELECT AGG is NONE, except for matching to any keywords in Table TABREF8 . The coverage of our rule on training set is 78.4%, with execution accuracy of 77.9%.\n\nKnowledge-Based Question Answering\n-----\nOur rule for KBQA is simple without using a curated mapping dictionary. First, we detect an entity from the question using strict string matching, with the constraint that only one entity from the KB has the same surface string and that the question contains only one entity. After that, we get the connected relations of the detected entity, and assign the relation as the one with maximum number of co-occurred words. The coverage of our rule on training set is 16.0%, with an accuracy of 97.3% for relation prediction.\n\nConversational Table-Based Semantic Parsing\n-----\nThe pipeline of rules in SequentialQA is similar to that of WikiSQL. Compared to the grammar of WikiSQL, the grammar of SequentialQA has additional actions including copying the previous-turn logical form, no greater than, no more than, and negation. Table TABREF23 shows the additional word-level mapping table used in SequentialQA. The coverage of our rule on training set is 75.5%, with an accuracy of 38.5%.\n\n"

  "abstract": "The lack of labeled training data has limited the development of natural language processing tools, such as named entity recognition, for many languages spoken in developing countries. Techniques such as distant and weak supervision can be used to create labeled data in a (semi-) automatic way. Additionally, to alleviate some of the negative effects of the errors in automatic annotation, noise-handling methods can be integrated. Pretrained word embeddings are another key component of most neural named entity classifiers. With the advent of more complex contextual word embeddings, an interesting trade-off between model size and performance arises. While these techniques have been shown to work well in high-resource settings, we want to study how they perform in low-resource scenarios. In this work, we perform named entity recognition for Hausa and Yor\\`ub\\'a, two languages that are widely spoken in several developing countries. We evaluate different embedding approaches and show that distant supervision can be successfully leveraged in a realistic low-resource scenario where it can more than double a classifier's performance.",
  "question": "What was performance of classifiers before/after using distant supervision?",
  "answer": "Bi-LSTM: For low resource <17k clean data: Using distant supervision resulted in huge boost of F1 score (1k eg. ~9 to ~36 wit distant supervision)\nBERT: <5k clean data boost of F1 (1k eg. ~32 to ~47 with distant supervision)",
  "evidence": "Results\n-----\nThe experimental results for Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 are given in Figure FIGREF11. The setting differs from the experiments with Hausa in that there is a small clean training set and additional, distantly-supervised data. For the Bi-LSTM model, adding distantly-supervised labels always helps. In the low-resource settings with 1k and 2k labeled data, it more than doubles the performance. Handling the noise in the distant supervision can result in slight improvements. The noise-cleaning approach struggles somewhat while the confusion matrix architecture does give better results in the majority of the scenarios. Training on 5k labeled data with distantly supervised data and noise handling, one can obtain a performance close to using the full 17k manually labeled token.\n\n"

As drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may cause adverse reactions, being able to extracting DDIs from drug labels into machine-readable form is an important effort in effectively deploying drug safety information. The DDI track of TAC 2018 introduces two large hand-annotated test sets for the task of extracting DDIs from structured product labels with linkage to standard terminologies. Herein, we describe our approach to tackling tasks one and two of the DDI track, which corresponds to named entity recognition (NER) and sentence-level relation extraction respectively. Namely, our approach resembles a multi-task learning framework designed to jointly model various sub-tasks including NER and interaction type and outcome prediction. On NER, our system ranked second (among eight teams) at 33.00% and 38.25% F1 on Test Sets 1 and 2 respectively.

Two test sets of 57 and 66 drug labels, referred to as Test Set 1 and 2 respectively, with gold standard annotations are used to evaluate participating systems. As Training-22 is a relatively small dataset, we additionally utilize an external dataset with 180 annotated drug labels dubbed NLM-180 BIBREF5 (more later). We provide summary statistics about these datasets in Table TABREF3 . Test Set 1 closely resembles Training-22 with respect to the sections that are annotated. However, Test Set 1 is more sparse in the sense that there are more sentences per drug label (144 vs. 27), with a smaller proportion of those sentences having gold annotations (23% vs. 51%). Test Set 2 is unique in that it contains annotations from only two sections, namely DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, the latter of which is not represented in Training-22 (nor Test Set 1).

  "abstract": "This paper tackles the goal of conclusion-supplement answer generation for non-factoid questions, which is a critical issue in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), as users often require supplementary information before accepting a conclusion. The current encoder-decoder framework, however, has difficulty generating such answers, since it may become confused when it tries to learn several different long answers to the same non-factoid question. Our solution, called an ensemble network, goes beyond single short sentences and fuses logically connected conclusion statements and supplementary statements. It extracts the context from the conclusion decoder's output sequence and uses it to create supplementary decoder states on the basis of an attention mechanism. It also assesses the closeness of the question encoder's output sequence and the separate outputs of the conclusion and supplement decoders as well as their combination. As a result, it generates answers that match the questions and have natural-sounding supplementary sequences in line with the context expressed by the conclusion sequence. Evaluations conducted on datasets including \"Love Advice\" and \"Arts & Humanities\" categories indicate that our model outputs much more accurate results than the tested baseline models do.",
  "question": "How much more accurate is the model than the baseline?",
  "answer": "For the Oshiete-goo dataset, the NAGM model's ROUGE-L score is higher than the highest performing conventional model, Trans, by 0.021, and its BLEU-4 score is higher than the highest performing model CLSTM by 0.037.  For the nfL6 dataset, the NAGM model's ROUGE-L score is higher than the highest performing conventional model, CLSTM, by 0.028, and its BLEU-4 score is higher than the highest performing model CLSTM by 0.040. Human evaluation of the NAGM's generated outputs for the Oshiete-goo dataset had 47% ratings of (1), the highest rating, while CLSTM only received 21% ratings of (1). For the nfL6 dataset, the comparison of (1)'s was NAGM's 50% to CLSTM's 30%. ",
  "evidence": "Evaluation ::: Results ::: Performance\n-----\nNAGMWA is much better than the other methods except NAGM, since it generates answers whose conclusions and supplements as well as their combinations closely match the questions. Thus, conclusions and supplements in the answers are consistent with each other and avoid confusion made by several different conclusion-supplement answers assigned to a single non-factoid questions. Finally, NAGM is consistently superior to the conventional attentive encoder-decoders regardless of the metric. Its ROUGE-L and BLEU-4 scores are much higher than those of CLSTM. Thus, NAGM generates more fluent sentences by assessing the context from conclusion to supplement sentences in addition to the closeness of the question and sentences as well as that of the question and sentence combinations.\n\nEvaluation ::: Results ::: Human evaluation\n-----\nThe experts asked questions, which were not included in our training datasets, to the AI system and rated the answers; one answer per question. The experts rated the answers as follows: (1) the content of the answer matched the question, and the grammar was okay; (2) the content was suitable, but the grammar was poor; (3) the content was not suitable, but the grammar was okay; (4) both the content and grammar were poor. Note that our evaluation followed the DUC-style strategy. Here, we mean \u201cgrammar\u201d to cover grammaticality, non-redundancy, and referential clarity in the DUC strategy, whereas we mean the \u201ccontent matched the questions\u201d to refer to \u201cfocus\u201d and \u201cstructure and coherence\u201d in the DUC strategy. The evaluators were given more than a week to carefully evaluate the generated answers, so we consider that their judgments are reliable. Each expert evaluated 50 questions. We combined the scores of the experts by summing them. They did not know the identity of the system in the evaluation and reached their decisions independently.\n\nEvaluation ::: Results ::: Human evaluation\n-----\nThese results indicate that the experts were much more satisfied with the outputs of NAGM than those of CLSTM. This is because, as can be seen in Table 7, NAGM generated longer and better question-related sentences than CLSTM did. NAGM generated grammatically good answers whose conclusion and supplement statements are well matched with the question and the supplement statement naturally follows the conclusion statement.\n\n"

  "abstract": "As a fundamental NLP task, semantic role labeling (SRL) aims to discover the semantic roles for each predicate within one sentence. This paper investigates how to incorporate syntactic knowledge into the SRL task effectively. We present different approaches of encoding the syntactic information derived from dependency trees of different quality and representations; we propose a syntax-enhanced self-attention model and compare it with other two strong baseline methods; and we conduct experiments with newly published deep contextualized word representations as well. The experiment results demonstrate that with proper incorporation of the high quality syntactic information, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for the Chinese SRL task on the CoNLL-2009 dataset.",
  "question": "What is new state-of-the-art performance on CoNLL-2009 dataset?",
  "answer": "In closed setting 84.22 F1 and in open 87.35 F1.",
  "evidence": "Experiment ::: Final Results on the Chinese Test Data\n-----\nTable TABREF46 shows that our Open model achieves more than 3 points of f1-score than the state-of-the-art result, and RelAwe with DepPath&RelPath achieves the best in both Closed and Open settings. Notice that our best Closed model can almost perform as well as the state-of-the-art model while the latter utilizes pre-trained word embeddings. Besides, performance gap between three models under Open setting is very small. It indicates that the representation ability of BERT is so powerful and may contains rich syntactic information. At last, the Gold result is much higher than the other models, indicating that there is still large space for improvement for this task.\n\n"

  "title": "Multi-modal Dense Video Captioning",
  "abstract": "Dense video captioning is a task of localizing interesting events from an untrimmed video and producing textual description (captions) for each localized event. Most of the previous works in dense video captioning are solely based on visual information and completely ignore the audio track. However, audio, and speech, in particular, are vital cues for a human observer in understanding an environment. In this paper, we present a new dense video captioning approach that is able to utilize any number of modalities for event description. Specifically, we show how audio and speech modalities may improve a dense video captioning model. We apply automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to obtain a temporally aligned textual description of the speech (similar to subtitles) and treat it as a separate input alongside video frames and the corresponding audio track. We formulate the captioning task as a machine translation problem and utilize recently proposed Transformer architecture to convert multi-modal input data into textual descriptions. We demonstrate the performance of our model on ActivityNet Captions dataset. The ablation studies indicate a considerable contribution from audio and speech components suggesting that these modalities contain substantial complementary information to video frames. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of the ActivityNet Caption results by leveraging the category tags obtained from original YouTube videos. The program code of our method and evaluations will be made publicly available.",

The dataset contains approximately 20k videos from YouTube and split into 50/25/25 % parts for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Each video, on average, contains 3.65 temporally localized captions, around 13.65 words each, and two minutes long. In addition, each video in the validation set is annotated twice by different annotators. We report all results using the validation set (no ground truth is provided for the test set).\n\n"

  "title": "Emotionally-Aware Chatbots: A Survey",
  "abstract": "Textual conversational agent or chatbots' development gather tremendous traction from both academia and industries in recent years. Nowadays, chatbots are widely used as an agent to communicate with a human in some services such as booking assistant, customer service, and also a personal partner. The biggest challenge in building chatbot is to build a humanizing machine to improve user engagement. Some studies show that emotion is an important aspect to humanize machine, including chatbot. In this paper, we will provide a systematic review of approaches in building an emotionally-aware chatbot (EAC). As far as our knowledge, there is still no work focusing on this area. We propose three research question regarding EAC studies. We start with the history and evolution of EAC, then several approaches to build EAC by previous studies, and some available resources in building EAC. Based on our investigation, we found that in the early development, EAC exploits a simple rule-based approach while now most of EAC use neural-based approach. We also notice that most of EAC contain emotion classifier in their architecture, which utilize several available affective resources. We also predict that the development of EAC will continue to gain more and more attention from scholars, noted by some recent studies propose new datasets for building EAC in various languages.",
  "question": "How are EAC evaluated?",
  "answer": "Qualitatively through efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction aspects and quantitatively through metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, BLEU score and even human judgement.",
  "evidence": "Evaluating EAC\n-----\nWe characterize the evaluation of Emotionally-Aware Chatbot into two different parts, qualitative and quantitative assessment. Qualitative assessment will focus on assessing the functionality of the software, while quantitative more focus on measure the chatbots' performance with a number.\n\nQualitative Assessment\n-----\nBased on our investigation of several previous studies, we found that most of the works utilized ISO 9241 to assess chatbots' quality by focusing on the usability aspect. This aspect can be grouped into three focuses, including efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction, concerning systems' performance to achieve the specified goals. Here we will explain every focus based on several categories and quality attributes.\n\nQuantitative Assessment\n-----\nIn automatic evaluation, some studies focus on evaluating the system at emotion level BIBREF15 , BIBREF28 . Therefore, some common metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy are used to measure system performance, compared to the gold label. This evaluation is similar to emotion classification tasks such as previous SemEval 2018 BIBREF32 and SemEval 2019 . Other studies also proposed to use perplexity to evaluate the model at the content level (to determine whether the content is relevant and grammatical) BIBREF14 , BIBREF39 , BIBREF28 . This evaluation metric is widely used to evaluate dialogue-based systems which rely on probabilistic approach BIBREF61 . Another work by BIBREF14 used BLEU to evaluate the machine response and compare against the gold response (the actual response), although using BLEU to measure conversation generation task is not recommended by BIBREF62 due to its low correlation with human judgment.\n\nQuantitative Assessment\n-----\nThis evaluation involves human judgement to measure the chatbots' performance, based on several criteria. BIBREF15 used three annotators to rate chatbots' response in two criteria, content (scale 0,1,2) and emotion (scale 0,1). Content is focused on measuring whether the response is natural acceptable and could plausible produced by a human. This metric measurement is already adopted and recommended by researchers and conversation challenging tasks, as proposed in BIBREF38 . Meanwhile, emotion is defined as whether the emotion expression contained in the response agrees with the given gold emotion category. Similarly, BIBREF28 used four annotators to score the response based on consistency, logic and emotion. Consistency measures the fluency and grammatical aspect of the response. Logic measures the degree whether the post and response logically match. Emotion measures the response, whether it contains the appropriate emotion. All of these aspects were measured by three scales 0, 1, and 2. Meanwhile, BIBREF39 proposed naturalness and emotion impact as criteria to evaluate the chatbots' response. Naturalness evaluates whether the response is intelligible, logically follows the context of the conversation, and acceptable as a human response, while emotion impact measures whether the response elicits a positive emotional or triggers an emotionally-positive dialogue, since their study focus only on positive emotion. Another study by BIBREF14 uses crowdsourcing to gather human judgement based on three aspects of performance including empathy/sympathy - did the responses show understanding of the feelings of the person talking about their experience?; relevance - did the responses seem appropriate to the conversation? Were they on-topic?; and fluency - could you understand the responses? Did the language seem accurate?. All of these aspects recorded with three different response, i.e., (1: not at all, 3: somewhat, 5: very much) from around 100 different annotators. After getting all of the human judgement with different criteria, some of these studies used a t-test to get the statistical significance BIBREF28 , BIBREF39 , while some other used inter-annotator agreement measurement such as Fleiss Kappa BIBREF15 , BIBREF14 . Based on these evaluations, they can compare their system performance with baseline or any other state of the art systems.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) approach for low-resource ASR is a relatively new direction in speech research. The approach benefits by performing model training without using lexicon and alignments. However, this poses a new problem of requiring more data compared to conventional DNN-HMM systems. In this work, we attempt to use data from 10 BABEL languages to build a multi-lingual seq2seq model as a prior model, and then port them towards 4 other BABEL languages using transfer learning approach. We also explore different architectures for improving the prior multilingual seq2seq model. The paper also discusses the effect of integrating a recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) with a seq2seq model during decoding. Experimental results show that the transfer learning approach from the multilingual model shows substantial gains over monolingual models across all 4 BABEL languages. Incorporating an RNNLM also brings significant improvements in terms of %WER, and achieves recognition performance comparable to the models trained with twice more training data.",

  "abstract": "In low-resource settings, the performance of supervised labeling models can be improved with automatically annotated or distantly supervised data, which is cheap to create but often noisy. Previous works have shown that significant improvements can be reached by injecting information about the confusion between clean and noisy labels in this additional training data into the classifier training. However, for noise estimation, these approaches either do not take the input features (in our case word embeddings) into account, or they need to learn the noise modeling from scratch which can be difficult in a low-resource setting. We propose to cluster the training data using the input features and then compute different confusion matrices for each cluster. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to leverage feature-dependent noise modeling with pre-initialized confusion matrices. We evaluate on low-resource named entity recognition settings in several languages, showing that our methods improve upon other confusion-matrix based methods by up to 9%.",

The advanced modeling of the noisy labels substantially improves the performance up to 36% over methods without noise-handling and up to 9% over all other noise-handling baselines.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Some users of social media are spreading racist, sexist, and otherwise hateful content. For the purpose of training a hate speech detection system, the reliability of the annotations is crucial, but there is no universally agreed-upon definition. We collected potentially hateful messages and asked two groups of internet users to determine whether they were hate speech or not, whether they should be banned or not and to rate their degree of offensiveness. One of the groups was shown a definition prior to completing the survey. We aimed to assess whether hate speech can be annotated reliably, and the extent to which existing definitions are in accordance with subjective ratings. Our results indicate that showing users a definition caused them to partially align their own opinion with the definition but did not improve reliability, which was very low overall. We conclude that the presence of hate speech should perhaps not be considered a binary yes-or-no decision, and raters need more detailed instructions for the annotation.",

Concurrently, they have also exposed how strongly human biases are encoded in vector spaces built on natural language. While finding that queen is the answer to man is to king as woman is to X leaves us in awe, papers have also reported finding analogies deeply infused with human biases, like man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker, which instead leave us with worry and rage. In this work we show that,often unknowingly, embedding spaces have not been treated fairly. Through a series of simple experiments, we highlight practical and theoretical problems in previous works, and demonstrate that some of the most widely used biased analogies are in fact not supported by the data.

Presented under the umbrella of the PharmaCoNER shared task, this paper describes a very simple method for the annotation and normalization of pharmacological, chemical and, ultimately, biomedical named entities in clinical cases. The system developed for the shared task is based on limited knowledge, collected, structured and munged in a way that clearly outperforms scores obtained by similar dictionary-based systems for English in the past. Along with this recovering of the knowledge-based methods for NER in subdomains, the paper also highlights the key contribution of resource-based systems in the validation and consolidation of both the annotation guidelines and the human annotation practices. In this sense, some of the authors discoverings on the overall quality of human annotated datasets question the above-mentioned `official' results obtained by this system, that ranked second (0.91 F1-score) and first (0.916 F1-score), respectively, in the two PharmaCoNER subtasks.",

  "abstract": "We explore the utilities of explicit negative examples in training neural language models. Negative examples here are incorrect words in a sentence, such as\"barks\"in\"*The dogs barks\". Neural language models are commonly trained only on positive examples, a set of sentences in the training data, but recent studies suggest that the models trained in this way are not capable of robustly handling complex syntactic constructions, such as long-distance agreement. In this paper, using English data, we first demonstrate that appropriately using negative examples about particular constructions (e.g., subject-verb agreement) will boost the model's robustness on them, with a negligible loss of perplexity. The key to our success is an additional margin loss between the log-likelihoods of a correct word and an incorrect word. We then provide a detailed analysis of the trained models. One of our findings is the difficulty of object-relative clauses for RNNs. We find that even with our direct learning signals the models still suffer from resolving agreement across an object-relative clause. Augmentation of training sentences involving the constructions somewhat helps, but the accuracy still does not reach the level of subject-relative clauses. Although not directly cognitively appealing, our method can be a tool to analyze the true architectural limitation of neural models on challenging linguistic constructions.",

We create three additional training datasets by adding sentences involving object RCs to the original Wikipedia corpus (Section lm). To this end, we randomly pick up 30 million sentences from Wikipedia (not overlapped to any sentences in the original corpus), parse by the same parser, and filter sentences containing an object RC, amounting to 680,000 sentences. Among the test cases about object RCs, we compare accuracies on subject-verb agreement, to make a comparison with subject RCs. We also evaluate on \u201canimate only\u201d subset, which has a correspondence to the test cases for subject RC with only differences in word order and inflection (like (UNKREF45) and (UNKREF46); see footnote FOOTREF47). Of particular interest to us is the accuracy on these animate cases.

In this work, we propose an information-theoretic approach to geographic language variation using a corpus based on Twitter. We test our models with tens of concepts and their associated keywords detected in Spanish tweets geolocated in Spain. We employ dialectometric measures (cosine similarity and Jensen-Shannon divergence) to quantify the linguistic distance on the lexical level between cells created in a uniform grid over the map. This can be done for a single concept or in the general case taking into account an average of the considered variants. The latter permits an analysis of the dialects that naturally emerge from the data. Interestingly, our results reveal the existence of two dialect macrovarieties. The first group includes a region-specific speech spoken in small towns and rural areas whereas the second cluster encompasses cities that tend to use a more uniform variety. Since the results obtained with the two different metrics qualitatively agree, our work suggests that social media corpora can be efficiently used for dialectometric analyses.",

  "evidence": "Global distance\n-----\nAfter averaging over all concepts, we lose information on the lexical variation that each concept presents but on the other hand one can now investigate which regions show similar geolectal variation, yielding well defined linguistic varieties. Those cells that have similar colors in either figure FIGREF16 or figure FIGREF17 are expected to be ascribed to the same dialect zone. Thus, we can distinguish two main regions or clusters in the maps. The purple background covers most of the map and represents rural regions with small, scattered population. Our analysis shows that this group of cells possesses more specific words in their lexicon. In contrast, the green and yellow cells form a second cluster that is largely concentrated on the center and along the coastline, which correspond to big cities and industrialized areas. In these cells, the use of standard Spanish language is widespread due probably to school education, media, travelers, etc. The character of its vocabulary is more uniform as compared with the purple group. While the purple cluster prefer particular utterances, the lexicon of the urban group includes most of the keywords. Importantly, we emphasize that both distance measures (cosine similarity and Jensen-Shanon) give rise to the same result, with little discrepancies on the numerical values that are not significant. The presence of two Twitter superdialects (urban and rural) has been recently suggested BIBREF10 based on a machine learning approach. Here, we arrive at the same conclusion but with a totally distinct model and corpus. The advantage of our proposal is that it may serve as a useful tool for dialectometric purposes.\n\n"

  "evidence": "Global distance\n-----\nAfter averaging over all concepts, we lose information on the lexical variation that each concept presents but on the other hand one can now investigate which regions show similar geolectal variation, yielding well defined linguistic varieties. Those cells that have similar colors in either figure FIGREF16 or figure FIGREF17 are expected to be ascribed to the same dialect zone. Thus, we can distinguish two main regions or clusters in the maps. The purple background covers most of the map and represents rural regions with small, scattered population. Our analysis shows that this group of cells possesses more specific words in their lexicon. In contrast, the green and yellow cells form a second cluster that is largely concentrated on the center and along the coastline, which correspond to big cities and industrialized areas. In these cells, the use of standard Spanish language is widespread due probably to school education, media, travelers, etc. The character of its vocabulary is more uniform as compared with the purple group. While the purple cluster prefer particular utterances, the lexicon of the urban group includes most of the keywords. Importantly, we emphasize that both distance measures (cosine similarity and Jensen-Shanon) give rise to the same result, with little discrepancies on the numerical values that are not significant. The presence of two Twitter superdialects (urban and rural) has been recently suggested BIBREF10 based on a machine learning approach. Here, we arrive at the same conclusion but with a totally distinct model and corpus. The advantage of our proposal is that it may serve as a useful tool for dialectometric purposes.\n\n"

Deep learning tends to emphasize on sentence level semantics when learning a representation with models like recurrent neural network or recursive neural network, however from the success of TF-IDF representation, it seems a bag-of-words type of representation has its strength. Taking advantage of both representions, we present a model known as TDSM (Top Down Semantic Model) for extracting a sentence representation that considers both the word-level semantics by linearly combining the words with attention weights and the sentence-level semantics with BiLSTM and use it on text classification.

  "abstract": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is to predict the sentiment polarity towards a particular aspect in a sentence. Recently, this task has been widely addressed by the neural attention mechanism, which computes attention weights to softly select words for generating aspect-specific sentence representations. The attention is expected to concentrate on opinion words for accurate sentiment prediction. However, attention is prone to be distracted by noisy or misleading words, or opinion words from other aspects. In this paper, we propose an alternative hard-selection approach, which determines the start and end positions of the opinion snippet, and selects the words between these two positions for sentiment prediction. Specifically, we learn deep associations between the sentence and aspect, and the long-term dependencies within the sentence by leveraging the pre-trained BERT model. We further detect the opinion snippet by self-critical reinforcement learning. Especially, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and prove that our hard-selection approach outperforms soft-selection approaches when handling multi-aspect sentences.",

Take Figure FIGREF1 as an example, for the aspect place in the sentence \u201cthe food is usually good but it certainly is not a relaxing place to go\u201d, we visualize the attention weights from the model ATAE-LSTM BIBREF2.

  "question": "What are the weaknesses of their proposed interpretability quantification method?",
  "answer": "can be biased by dataset used and may generate categories which are suboptimal compared to human designed categories",
  "evidence": "Measuring Interpretability\n-----\nOur interpretability measurements are based on our proposed dataset SEMCAT, which was designed to be a comprehensive dataset that contains a diverse set of word categories. Yet, it is possible that the precise interpretability scores that are measured here are biased by the dataset used. In general, two main properties of the dataset can affect the results: category selection and within-category word selection. To examine the effects of these properties on interpretability evaluations, we create alternative datasets by varying both category selection and word selection for SEMCAT. Since SEMCAT is comprehensive in terms of the words it contains for the categories, these datasets are created by subsampling the categories and words included in SEMCAT. Since random sampling of words within a category may perturb the capacity of the dataset in reflecting human judgement, we subsample r% of the words that are closest to category centers within each category, where $r \\in \\lbrace 40,60,80,100\\rbrace $ . To examine the importance of number of categories in the dataset we randomly select $m$ categories from SEMCAT where $m \\in \\lbrace 30,50,70,90,110\\rbrace $ . We repeat the selection 10 times independently for each $m$ .\n\nMeasuring Interpretability\n-----\nIn contrast to the category coverage, the effects of within-category word coverage on interpretability scores can be more complex. Starting with few words within each category, increasing the number of words is expected to more uniformly sample from the word distribution, more accurately reflect the semantic relations within each category and thereby enhance interpretability scores. However, having categories over-abundant in words might inevitably weaken semantic correlations among them, reducing the discriminability of the categories and interpretability of the embedding. Table 3 shows that, interestingly, changing the category coverage has different effects on the interpretability scores of different types of embeddings. As category word coverage increases, interpretability scores for random embedding gradually decrease while they monotonically increase for the GloVe embedding. For semantic spaces $\\mathcal {I}$ and $\\mathcal {I}^*$ , interpretability scores increase as the category coverage increases up to 80 $\\%$ of that of SEMCAT, then the scores decrease. This may be a result of having too comprehensive categories as argued earlier, implying that categories with coverage of around 80 $\\%$ of SEMCAT are better suited for measuring interpretability. However, it should be noted that the change in the interpretability scores for different word coverages might be effected by non-ideal subsampling of category words. Although our word sampling method, based on words' distances to category centers, is expected to generate categories that are represented better compared to random sampling of category words, category representations might be suboptimal compared to human designed categories.\n\n"

  "answer": "it is less expensive and quantifies interpretability using continuous values rather than binary evaluations",
  "evidence": "Related Work\n-----\nIn the word embedding literature, the problem of interpretability has been approached via several different routes. For learning sparse, interpretable word representations from co-occurrence variant matrices, BIBREF21 suggested algorithms based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and the resulting representations are called non-negative sparse embeddings (NNSE). To address memory and scale issues of the algorithms in BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 proposed an online method of learning interpretable word embeddings. In both studies, interpretability was evaluated using a word intrusion test introduced in BIBREF20 . The word intrusion test is expensive to apply since it requires manual evaluations by human observers separately for each embedding dimension. As an alternative method to incorporate human judgement, BIBREF23 proposed joint non-negative sparse embedding (JNNSE), where the aim is to combine text-based similarity information among words with brain activity based similarity information to improve interpretability. Yet, this approach still requires labor-intensive collection of neuroimaging data from multiple subjects.\n\nMeasuring Interpretability\n-----\nIn addition to investigating the semantic distribution in the embedding space, a word category dataset can be also used to quantify the interpretability of the word embeddings. In several studies, BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF20 , interpretability is evaluated using the word intrusion test. In the word intrusion test, for each embedding dimension, a word set is generated including the top 5 words in the top ranks and a noisy word (intruder) in the bottom ranks of that dimension. The intruder is selected such that it is in the top ranks of a separate dimension. Then, human editors are asked to determine the intruder word within the generated set. The editors' performances are used to quantify the interpretability of the embedding. Although evaluating interpretability based on human judgements is an effective approach, word intrusion is an expensive method since it requires human effort for each evaluation. Furthermore, the word intrusion test does not quantify the interpretability levels of the embedding dimensions, instead it yields a binary decision as to whether a dimension is interpretable or not. However, using continuous values is more adequate than making binary evaluations since interpretability levels may vary gradually across dimensions.\n\n"

  "abstract": "Creative tasks such as ideation or question proposal are powerful applications of crowdsourcing, yet the quantity of workers available for addressing practical problems is often insufficient. To enable scalable crowdsourcing thus requires gaining all possible efficiency and information from available workers. One option for text-focused tasks is to allow assistive technology, such as an autocompletion user interface (AUI), to help workers input text responses. But support for the efficacy of AUIs is mixed. Here we designed and conducted a randomized experiment where workers were asked to provide short text responses to given questions. Our experimental goal was to determine if an AUI helps workers respond more quickly and with improved consistency by mitigating typos and misspellings. Surprisingly, we found that neither occurred: workers assigned to the AUI treatment were slower than those assigned to the non-AUI control and their responses were more diverse, not less, than those of the control. Both the lexical and semantic diversities of responses were higher, with the latter measured using word2vec. A crowdsourcer interested in worker speed may want to avoid using an AUI, but using an AUI to boost response diversity may be valuable to crowdsourcers interested in receiving as much novel information from workers as possible.",

  "answer": "By computing number of unique responses and number of responses divided by the number of unique responses to that question for each of the questions",

First, we aggregated all worker responses to a particular question into a single list corresponding to that question. Across all questions, we found that the number of unique responses was higher for the AUI than for the Control (Fig. FIGREF19 A), implying higher diversity for AUI than for Control.\n\nDifferences in response diversity\n-----\nSecond, we compared the diversity of individual responses between Control and AUI for each question. To measure diversity for a question, we computed the number of responses divided by the number of unique responses to that question. We call this the response density. A set of responses has a response density of 1 when every response is unique but when every response is the same, the response density is equal to the number of responses. Across the ten questions, response density was significantly lower for AUI than for Control (Wilcoxon signed rank test paired on questions: INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 ) (Fig. FIGREF19 B).\n\n"

  "abstract": "Abstractive text summarization is a highly difficult problem, and the sequence-to-sequence model has shown success in improving the performance on the task. However, the generated summaries are often inconsistent with the source content in semantics. In such cases, when generating summaries, the model selects semantically unrelated words with respect to the source content as the most probable output. The problem can be attributed to heuristically constructed training data, where summaries can be unrelated to the source content, thus containing semantically unrelated words and spurious word correspondence. In this paper, we propose a regularization approach for the sequence-to-sequence model and make use of what the model has learned to regularize the learning objective to alleviate the effect of the problem. In addition, we propose a practical human evaluation method to address the problem that the existing automatic evaluation method does not evaluate the semantic consistency with the source content properly. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperforms almost all the existing models. Especially, the proposed approach improves the semantic consistency by 4\\% in terms of human evaluation.",
  "question": "What human evaluation method is proposed?",
  "answer": "comparing the summary with the text instead of the reference and labeling the candidate bad if it is incorrect or irrelevant",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nMore detailed explanation is introduced in Section SECREF2 . Another problem for abstractive text summarization is that the system summary cannot be easily evaluated automatically. ROUGE BIBREF9 is widely used for summarization evaluation. However, as ROUGE is designed for extractive text summarization, it cannot deal with summary paraphrasing in abstractive text summarization. Besides, as ROUGE is based on the reference, it requires high-quality reference summary for a reasonable evaluation, which is also lacking in the existing dataset for Chinese social media text summarization. We argue that for proper evaluation of text generation task, human evaluation cannot be avoided. We propose a simple and practical human evaluation for evaluating text summarization, where the summary is evaluated against the source content instead of the reference. It handles both of the problems of paraphrasing and lack of high-quality reference. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n\nEvaluation Protocol\n-----\nFor text summarization, a common automatic evaluation method is ROUGE BIBREF9 . The generated summary is evaluated against the reference summary, based on unigram recall (ROUGE-1), bigram recall (ROUGE-2), and recall of longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L). To facilitate comparison with the existing systems, we adopt ROUGE as the automatic evaluation method. The ROUGE is calculated on the character level, following the previous work BIBREF1 . However, for abstractive text summarization, the ROUGE is sub-optimal, and cannot assess the semantic consistency between the summary and the source content, especially when there is only one reference for a piece of text. The reason is that the same content may be expressed in different ways with different focuses. Simple word match cannot recognize the paraphrasing. It is the case for all of the existing large-scale datasets. Besides, as aforementioned, ROUGE is calculated on the character level in Chinese text summarization, making the metrics favor the models on the character level in practice. In Chinese, a word is the smallest semantic element that can be uttered in isolation, not a character. In the extreme case, the generated text could be completely intelligible, but the characters could still match. In theory, calculating ROUGE metrics on the word level could alleviate the problem. However, word segmentation is also a non-trivial task for Chinese. There are many kinds of segmentation rules, which will produce different ROUGE scores. We argue that it is not acceptable to introduce additional systematic bias in automatic evaluations, and automatic evaluation for semantically related tasks can only serve as a reference. To avoid the deficiencies, we propose a simple human evaluation method to assess the semantic consistency. Each summary candidate is evaluated against the text rather than the reference. If the candidate is irrelevant or incorrect to the text, or the candidate is not understandable, the candidate is labeled bad. Otherwise, the candidate is labeled good. Then, we can get an accuracy of the good summaries. The proposed evaluation is very simple and straight-forward. It focuses on the relevance between the summary and the text. The semantic consistency should be the major consideration when putting the text summarization methods into practice, but the current automatic methods cannot judge properly. For detailed guidelines in human evaluation, please refer to Appendix SECREF6 . In the human evaluation, the text-summary pairs are dispatched to two human annotators who are native speakers of Chinese. As in our setting the summary is evaluated against the reference, the number of the pairs needs to be manually evaluated is four times the number of the pairs in the test set, because we need to compare four systems in total. To decrease the workload and get a hint about the annotation quality at the same time, we adopt the following procedure. We first randomly select 100 pairs in the validation set for the two human annotators to evaluate. Each pair is annotated twice, and the inter-annotator agreement is checked. We find that under the protocol, the inter-annotator agreement is quite high. In the evaluation of the test set, a pair is only annotated once to accelerate evaluation. To further maintain consistency, summaries of the same source content will not be distributed to different annotators.\n\n"

  "title": "Language Identification on Massive Datasets of Short Message using an Attention Mechanism CNN",
  "abstract": "Language Identification (LID) is a challenging task, especially when the input texts are short and noisy such as posts and statuses on social media or chat logs on gaming forums. The task has been tackled by either designing a feature set for a traditional classifier (e.g. Naive Bayes) or applying a deep neural network classifier (e.g. Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit, Encoder-Decoder). These methods are usually trained and tested on a huge amount of private data, then used and evaluated as off-the-shelf packages by other researchers using their own datasets, and consequently the various results published are not directly comparable. In this paper, we first create a new massive labelled dataset based on one year of Twitter data. We use this dataset to test several existing language identification systems, in order to obtain a set of coherent benchmarks, and we make our dataset publicly available so that others can add to this set of benchmarks. Finally, we propose a shallow but efficient neural LID system, which is a ngram-regional convolution neural network enhanced with an attention mechanism. Experimental results show that our architecture is able to predict tens of thousands of samples per second and surpasses all state-of-the-art systems with an improvement of 5%.",

  "evidence": "Our Twitter LID Datasets ::: Source Data and Language Labeling\n-----\nWe begin by filtering the corpus to keep only those tweets where the user's self-declared language and the tweet's detected language correspond; that language becomes the tweet's correct language label. This operation cuts out roughly half the tweets, and leaves us with a corpus of about 900 million tweets in 54 different languages. Table TABREF6 shows the distribution of languages in that corpus. Unsurprisingly, it is a very imbalanced distribution of languages, with English and Japanese together accounting for 60% of all tweets. This is consistent with other studies and statistics of language use on Twitter, going as far back as 2013. It does however make it very difficult to use this corpus to train a LID system for other languages, especially for one of the dozens of seldom-used languages. This was our motivation for creating a balanced Twitter dataset.\n\n"

  "title": "Global Greedy Dependency Parsing",
  "abstract": "Most syntactic dependency parsing models may fall into one of two categories: transition- and graph-based models. The former models enjoy high inference efficiency with linear time complexity, but they rely on the stacking or re-ranking of partially-built parse trees to build a complete parse tree and are stuck with slower training for the necessity of dynamic oracle training. The latter, graph-based models, may boast better performance but are unfortunately marred by polynomial time inference. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing order objective, resulting in a novel dependency parsing model capable of both global (in sentence scope) feature extraction as in graph models and linear time inference as in transitional models. The proposed global greedy parser only uses two arc-building actions, left and right arcs, for projective parsing. When equipped with two extra non-projective arc-building actions, the proposed parser may also smoothly support non-projective parsing. Using multiple benchmark treebanks, including the Penn Treebank (PTB), the CoNLL-X treebanks, and the Universal Dependency Treebanks, we evaluate our parser and demonstrate that the proposed novel parser achieves good performance with faster training and decoding.",

The comparison in Table TABREF24 shows that in terms of convergence time, our model is basically the same speed as BIAF, while STACKPTR is much slower. For decoding, our model is the fastest, followed by BIAF. STACKPTR is unexpectedly the slowest. This is because the time cost of attention scoring in decoding is not negligible when compared with the processing speed and actually even accounts for a significant portion of the runtime.\n\n"

  "title": "Learning Multilingual Word Embeddings Using Image-Text Data",
  "abstract": "There has been significant interest recently in learning multilingual word embeddings -- in which semantically similar words across languages have similar embeddings. State-of-the-art approaches have relied on expensive labeled data, which is unavailable for low-resource languages, or have involved post-hoc unification of monolingual embeddings. In the present paper, we investigate the efficacy of multilingual embeddings learned from weakly-supervised image-text data. In particular, we propose methods for learning multilingual embeddings using image-text data, by enforcing similarity between the representations of the image and that of the text. Our experiments reveal that even without using any expensive labeled data, a bag-of-words-based embedding model trained on image-text data achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on crosslingual semantic similarity tasks.",

Each (query, image) pair also has a weight corresponding to a relevance score of the image for the query. The dataset includes 3 billion (query, image, weight) triples, with 900 million unique images and 220 million unique queries. The data was prepared by first taking the query-image set, filtering to remove any personally identifiable information and adult content, and tokenizing the remaining queries by replacing special characters with spaces and trimming extraneous whitespace. Rare tokens (those that do not appear in queries at least six times) are filtered out. Each token in each query is given a language tag based on the user-set home language of the user making the search on Google Images. For example, if the query \u201cback pain\u201d is made by a user with English as her home language, then the query is stored as \u201cen:back en:pain\u201d.

  "title": "Generating Natural Language Inference Chains",
  "abstract": "The ability to reason with natural language is a fundamental prerequisite for many NLP tasks such as information extraction, machine translation and question answering. To quantify this ability, systems are commonly tested whether they can recognize textual entailment, i.e., whether one sentence can be inferred from another one. However, in most NLP applications only single source sentences instead of sentence pairs are available. Hence, we propose a new task that measures how well a model can generate an entailed sentence from a source sentence. We take entailment-pairs of the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus and train an LSTM with attention. On a manually annotated test set we found that 82% of generated sentences are correct, an improvement of 10.3% over an LSTM baseline. A qualitative analysis shows that this model is not only capable of shortening input sentences, but also inferring new statements via paraphrasing and phrase entailment. We then apply this model recursively to input-output pairs, thereby generating natural language inference chains that can be used to automatically construct an entailment graph from source sentences. Finally, by swapping source and target sentences we can also train a model that given an input sentence invents additional information to generate a new sentence.",
  "question": "How is the generative model evaluated?",
  "answer": "Comparing BLEU score of model with and without attention",
  "evidence": "Quantitative Evaluation\n-----\nWe train an LSTM with and without attention on the training set. After training, we take the best model in terms of BLEU score BIBREF16 on the development set and calculate the BLEU score on the test set. To our surprise, we found that using attention yields only a marginally higher BLEU score (43.1 vs. 42.8). We suspect that this is due to the fact that generating entailed sentences has a larger space of valid target sequences, which makes the use of BLEU problematic and penalizes correct solutions. Hence, we manually annotated 100 random test sentences and decided whether the generated sentence can indeed be inferred from the source sentence. We found that sentences generated by an LSTM with attention are substantially more accurate ( $82\\%$ accuracy) than those generated from an LSTM baseline ( $71.7\\%$ ). To gain more insights into the model's capabilities, we turn to a thorough qualitative analysis of the attention LSTM model in the remainder of this paper.\n\n"

  "title": "Assessing the Applicability of Authorship Verification Methods",
  "abstract": "Authorship verification (AV) is a research subject in the field of digital text forensics that concerns itself with the question, whether two documents have been written by the same person. During the past two decades, an increasing number of proposed AV approaches can be observed. However, a closer look at the respective studies reveals that the underlying characteristics of these methods are rarely addressed, which raises doubts regarding their applicability in real forensic settings. The objective of this paper is to fill this gap by proposing clear criteria and properties that aim to improve the characterization of existing and future AV approaches. Based on these properties, we conduct three experiments using 12 existing AV approaches, including the current state of the art. The examined methods were trained, optimized and evaluated on three self-compiled corpora, where each corpus focuses on a different aspect of applicability. Our results indicate that part of the methods are able to cope with very challenging verification cases such as 250 characters long informal chat conversations (72.7% accuracy) or cases in which two scientific documents were written at different times with an average difference of 15.6 years (>75% accuracy). However, we also identified that all involved methods are prone to cross-topic verification cases.",
  "question": "What are the 12 AV approaches which are examined?",

  "title": "A Trolling Hierarchy in Social Media and A Conditional Random Field For Trolling Detection",
  "abstract": "An-ever increasing number of social media websites, electronic newspapers and Internet forums allow visitors to leave comments for others to read and interact. This exchange is not free from participants with malicious intentions, which do not contribute with the written conversation. Among different communities users adopt strategies to handle such users. In this paper we present a comprehensive categorization of the trolling phenomena resource, inspired by politeness research and propose a model that jointly predicts four crucial aspects of trolling: intention, interpretation, intention disclosure and response strategy. Finally, we present a new annotated dataset containing excerpts of conversations involving trolls and the interactions with other users that we hope will be a useful resource for the research community.",
  "question": "how was annotation done?",
  "answer": "Annotation was done with the help of annotators from Amazon Mechanical Turk on snippets of conversations",
  "evidence": "Corpus and Annotations\n-----\nWith the gathered comments, we reconstructed the original conversation trees, from the original post, the root, to the leaves, when they were available and selected a subset to annotated. For annotation purposes, we created snippets of conversations as the ones shown in Example 1 and Example 2 consisting of the parent of the suspected trolling event, the suspected trolling event comment, and all of the direct responses to the suspected trolling event. We added an extra constraint that the parent of the suspected trolling event should also be part of the direct responses, we hypothesize that if the suspected trolling event is indeed trolling, its parent should be the object of its trolling and would have a say about it. We recognize that this limited amount of information is not always sufficient to recover the original message conveyed by all of the participants in the snippet, and additional context would be beneficial. However, the trade off is that snippets like this allow us to make use of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to have the dataset annotated, because it is not a big burden for a \u201cturker\u201d to work on an individual snippet in exchange for a small pay, and expedites the annotation process by distributing it over dozens of people. Specifically, for each snippet, we requested three annotators to label the four aspects previously described. Before annotating, we set up a qualification test along with borderline examples to guide them in process and align them with our criteria. The qualification test turned out to be very selective since only 5% of all of the turkers that attempted it passed the exam. Our dataset consists of 1000 conversations with 5868 sentences and 71033 tokens. The distribution over the classes per trolling aspect is shown in the table TABREF24 in the column \u201cSize\u201d.\n\n"

  "title": "e-QRAQ: A Multi-turn Reasoning Dataset and Simulator with Explanations",
  "abstract": "In this paper we present a new dataset and user simulator e-QRAQ (explainable Query, Reason, and Answer Question) which tests an Agent's ability to read an ambiguous text; ask questions until it can answer a challenge question; and explain the reasoning behind its questions and answer. The User simulator provides the Agent with a short, ambiguous story and a challenge question about the story. The story is ambiguous because some of the entities have been replaced by variables. At each turn the Agent may ask for the value of a variable or try to answer the challenge question. In response the User simulator provides a natural language explanation of why the Agent's query or answer was useful in narrowing down the set of possible answers, or not. To demonstrate one potential application of the e-QRAQ dataset, we train a new neural architecture based on End-to-End Memory Networks to successfully generate both predictions and partial explanations of its current understanding of the problem. We observe a strong correlation between the quality of the prediction and explanation.",
  "question": "How do they measure correlation between the prediction and explanation quality?",
  "answer": "They look at the performance accuracy of explanation and the prediction performance",
  "evidence": "Results\n-----\nWe would expect that explanation performance should correlate with prediction performance. Since Possible-answer knowledge is primarily needed to decide if the net has enough information to answer the challenge question without guessing and relevant-variable knowledge is needed for the net to know what to query, we analyzed the network's performance on querying and answering separately. The memory network has particular difficulty learning to query relevant variables, reaching only about .5 accuracy when querying. At the same time, it learns to answer very well, reaching over .9 accuracy there. Since these two parts of the interaction are what we ask it to explain in the two modes, we find that the quality of the explanations strongly correlates with the quality of the algorithm executed by the network.\n\n"

  "abstract": "We consider the task of KBP slot filling -- extracting relation information from newswire documents for knowledge base construction. We present our pipeline, which employs Relational Dependency Networks (RDNs) to learn linguistic patterns for relation extraction. Additionally, we demonstrate how several components such as weak supervision, word2vec features, joint learning and the use of human advice, can be incorporated in this relational framework. We evaluate the different components in the benchmark KBP 2015 task and show that RDNs effectively model a diverse set of features and perform competitively with current state-of-the-art relation extraction.",
  "question": "How do they incorporate human advice?",
  "answer": "by converting human advice to first-order logic format and use as an input to calculate gradient",
  "evidence": "Incorporating Human Advice\n-----\nWhile most relational learning methods restrict the human to merely annotating the data, we go beyond and request the human for advice. The intuition is that we as humans read certain patterns and use them to deduce the nature of the relation between two entities present in the text. The goal of our work is to capture such mental patterns of the humans as advice to the learning algorithm. We modified the work of Odom et al. odomAIME15,odomAAAI15 to learn RDNs in the presence of advice. The key idea is to explicitly represent advice in calculating gradients. This allows the system to trade-off between data and advice throughout the learning phase, rather than only consider advice in initial iterations. Advice, in particular, become influential in the presence of noisy or less amout of data. A few sample advice rules in English (these are converted to first-order logic format and given as input to our algorithm) are presented in Table TABREF11 . Note that some of the rules are \u201csoft\" rules in that they are not true in many situations. Odom et al. odomAAAI15 weigh the effect of the rules against the data and hence allow for partially correct rules.\n\n"

  "title": "Stance Classification for Rumour Analysis in Twitter: Exploiting Affective Information and Conversation Structure",
  "abstract": "Analysing how people react to rumours associated with news in social media is an important task to prevent the spreading of misinformation, which is nowadays widely recognized as a dangerous tendency. In social media conversations, users show different stances and attitudes towards rumourous stories. Some users take a definite stance, supporting or denying the rumour at issue, while others just comment it, or ask for additional evidence related to the veracity of the rumour. On this line, a new shared task has been proposed at SemEval-2017 (Task 8, SubTask A), which is focused on rumour stance classification in English tweets. The goal is predicting user stance towards emerging rumours in Twitter, in terms of supporting, denying, querying, or commenting the original rumour, looking at the conversation threads originated by the rumour. This paper describes a new approach to this task, where the use of conversation-based and affective-based features, covering different facets of affect, has been explored. Our classification model outperforms the best-performing systems for stance classification at SemEval-2017 Task 8, showing the effectiveness of the feature set proposed.",

  "title": "Improving Robustness of Task Oriented Dialog Systems",
  "abstract": "Task oriented language understanding in dialog systems is often modeled using intents (task of a query) and slots (parameters for that task). Intent detection and slot tagging are, in turn, modeled using sentence classification and word tagging techniques respectively. Similar to adversarial attack problems with computer vision models discussed in existing literature, these intent-slot tagging models are often over-sensitive to small variations in input -- predicting different and often incorrect labels when small changes are made to a query, thus reducing their accuracy and reliability. However, evaluating a model's robustness to these changes is harder for language since words are discrete and an automated change (e.g. adding `noise') to a query sometimes changes the meaning and thus labels of a query. In this paper, we first describe how to create an adversarial test set to measure the robustness of these models. Furthermore, we introduce and adapt adversarial training methods as well as data augmentation using back-translation to mitigate these issues. Our experiments show that both techniques improve the robustness of the system substantially and can be combined to yield the best results.",

We also included the results for the ensemble model, which combines the decisions of five separate baseline models that differ in batch order, initialization, and dropout masking. We can see that, similar to the case in computer vision BIBREF4, the adversarial examples seem to stem from fundamental properties of the neural networks and ensembling helps only a little.\n\n"

From all tweets in our stream from 2016 or 2017, we extract those tweets that have at least two @-mentions and all of the @-mentions have been seen at least five times in the background corpus. Based on the resulting 1.8 million lists of about 169,000 distinct user ids, we compute a topic model with INLINEFORM0 topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation BIBREF3 . For each of the user ids, we extract the most probable topic from the inferred user id-topic distribution as cluster id.

  "abstract": "Code-switching is a phenomenon of mixing grammatical structures of two or more languages under varied social constraints. The code-switching data differ so radically from the benchmark corpora used in NLP community that the application of standard technologies to these data degrades their performance sharply. Unlike standard corpora, these data often need to go through additional processes such as language identification, normalization and/or back-transliteration for their efficient processing. In this paper, we investigate these indispensable processes and other problems associated with syntactic parsing of code-switching data and propose methods to mitigate their effects. In particular, we study dependency parsing of code-switching data of Hindi and English multilingual speakers from Twitter. We present a treebank of Hindi-English code-switching tweets under Universal Dependencies scheme and propose a neural stacking model for parsing that efficiently leverages part-of-speech tag and syntactic tree annotations in the code-switching treebank and the preexisting Hindi and English treebanks. We also present normalization and back-transliteration models with a decoding process tailored for code-switching data. Results show that our neural stacking parser is 1.5% LAS points better than the augmented parsing model and our decoding process improves results by 3.8% LAS points over the first-best normalization and/or back-transliteration.",

Following bhat-EtAl:2017:EACLshort we first sampled CS data from a large set of tweets of Indian language users that we crawled from Twitter using Tweepy\u2013a Twitter API wrapper. We then used a language identification system trained on ICON dataset (see Section \"Preliminary Tasks\" ) to filter Hindi-English CS tweets from the crawled Twitter data. Only those tweets were selected that satisfied a minimum ratio of 30:70(%) code-switching. From this dataset, we manually selected 1,448 tweets for annotation. The selected tweets are thoroughly checked for code-switching ratio. For POS tagging and dependency annotation, we used Version 2 of Universal dependency guidelines BIBREF21 , while language tags are assigned based on the tag set defined in BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . The dataset was annotated by two expert annotators who have been associated with annotation projects involving syntactic annotations for around 10 years. Nonetheless, we also ensured the quality of the manual annotations by carrying an inter-annotator agreement analysis. We randomly selected a dataset of 150 tweets which were annotated by both annotators for both POS tagging and dependency structures. The inter-annotator agreement has a 96.20% accuracy for POS tagging and a 95.94% UAS and a 92.65% LAS for dependency parsing.\n\n"

In particular, we show that word frequency compression improves learning across a large range of variations in number of training pairs.

While the ASR component is identical across the experiments, the MMT model varies in terms of the way of integrating the visual context (simple conditioning vs. attention), the type of visual features exploited (pooled, convolutional, action categories) and the underlying architecture. For the latter, we explore both the canonical transformer and its deliberation version with additive and cascade variants which differ in how they integrate the textual attention. Upon conducting extensive experiments, we found that (i) the explored visual integration schemes often harm the translation performance for the transformer and additive deliberation, but considerably improve the cascade deliberation; (ii) the transformer and cascade deliberation integrate the visual modality better than the additive deliberation, as shown by the incongruence analysis.",
  "question": "Was evaluation metrics and criteria were used to evaluate the output of the cascaded multimodal speech translation?",

After the training finishes, we evaluate all the checkpoints on the validation set and compute the real BIBREF30 scores, based on which we select the best model for inference on the test set. The transformer and the deliberation models are based upon the library BIBREF31 (v1.3.0 RC1) as well as the vanilla transformer-based deliberation BIBREF20 and their multimodal variants BIBREF7.\n\n"

  "title": "Exploiting Invertible Decoders for Unsupervised Sentence Representation Learning",
  "abstract": "The encoder-decoder models for unsupervised sentence representation learning tend to discard the decoder after being trained on a large unlabelled corpus, since only the encoder is needed to map the input sentence into a vector representation. However, parameters learnt in the decoder also contain useful information about language. In order to utilise the decoder after learning, we present two types of decoding functions whose inverse can be easily derived without expensive inverse calculation. Therefore, the inverse of the decoding function serves as another encoder that produces sentence representations. We show that, with careful design of the decoding functions, the model learns good sentence representations, and the ensemble of the representations produced from the encoder and the inverse of the decoder demonstrate even better generalisation ability and solid transferability.",

In our case, the output $\\in ^{d_}$ of the decoding function $f_{\\text{de}}$ has lower dimensionality than the input $\\in ^{d_}$ does. Our solution is to add an orthonormal regularised linear projection before the bijective function to transform the vector representation of a sentence to the desired dimension.\n\n"

  "title": "Towards Scalable Multi-domain Conversational Agents: The Schema-Guided Dialogue Dataset",
  "abstract": "Virtual assistants such as Google Assistant, Alexa and Siri provide a conversational interface to a large number of services and APIs spanning multiple domains. Such systems need to support an ever-increasing number of services with possibly overlapping functionality. Furthermore, some of these services have little to no training data available. Existing public datasets for task-oriented dialogue do not sufficiently capture these challenges since they cover few domains and assume a single static ontology per domain. In this work, we introduce the the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset, containing over 16k multi-domain conversations spanning 16 domains. Our dataset exceeds the existing task-oriented dialogue corpora in scale, while also highlighting the challenges associated with building large-scale virtual assistants. It provides a challenging testbed for a number of tasks including language understanding, slot filling, dialogue state tracking and response generation. Along the same lines, we present a schema-guided paradigm for task-oriented dialogue, in which predictions are made over a dynamic set of intents and slots, provided as input, using their natural language descriptions. This allows a single dialogue system to easily support a large number of services and facilitates simple integration of new services without requiring additional training data. Building upon the proposed paradigm, we release a model for dialogue state tracking capable of zero-shot generalization to new APIs, while remaining competitive in the regular setting.",

We create synthetic implementations of a total of 34 services or APIs over these domains.

We then used a crowd-sourcing procedure to paraphrase these outlines to natural language utterances. Our novel crowd-sourcing procedure preserves all annotations obtained from the simulator and does not require any extra annotations after dialogue collection. In this section, we describe these steps in detail and then present analyses of the collected dataset.\n\n"

Since the test set is also hand-labeled we found that the 645 articles are much more representative of the final test set than the articles labeled by publisher. The model's performance on articles labeled by publisher was not much above chance level.\n\nImportance of Pre-training\n-----\nOur first experiment was checking the importance of pre-training. We pre-trained BERT-base on the 600,000 articles without labels by using the same Cloze task BIBREF5 that BERT had originally used for pre-training. We then trained the model on sequence lengths of 100, 250 and 500. The accuracy for each sequence length after 100 epochs is shown in TABREF7 and is labeled as UP (unsupervised pre-training). The other column shows how well BERT-base trained without pre-training. We found improvements for lower sequence lengths, but not at 500 word pieces. Since the longer chunk should have been more informative, and since our hand-labeled training set only contained 516 articles, this likely indicates that BERT experiences training difficulty when dealing with long sequences on such a small dataset. As the cost to do pre-training was only a one time cost all of our remaining experiments use a pre-trained model.\n\n"

Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised models on most benchmark tasks, highlighting the robustness of the produced general-purpose sentence embeddings.",

The breadth of tasks allows to fairly measure generalization to a wide area of different domains, testing the general-purpose quality (universality) of all competing sentence embeddings. For downstream supervised evaluations, sentence embeddings are combined with logistic regression to predict target labels. In the unsupervised evaluation for sentence similarity, correlation of the cosine similarity between two embeddings is compared to human annotators.\n\nEvaluation Tasks\n-----\nDownstream Supervised Evaluation. Sentence embeddings are evaluated for various supervised classification tasks as follows. We evaluate paraphrase identification (MSRP) BIBREF25 , classification of movie review sentiment (MR) BIBREF26 , product reviews (CR) BIBREF27 , subjectivity classification (SUBJ) BIBREF28 , opinion polarity (MPQA) BIBREF29 and question type classification (TREC) BIBREF30 . To classify, we use the code provided by BIBREF22 in the same manner as in BIBREF16 . For the MSRP dataset, containing pairs of sentences INLINEFORM0 with associated paraphrase label, we generate feature vectors by concatenating their Sent2Vec representations INLINEFORM1 with the component-wise product INLINEFORM2 . The predefined training split is used to tune the L2 penalty parameter using cross-validation and the accuracy and F1 scores are computed on the test set. For the remaining 5 datasets, Sent2Vec embeddings are inferred from input sentences and directly fed to a logistic regression classifier. Accuracy scores are obtained using 10-fold cross-validation for the MR, CR, SUBJ and MPQA datasets. For those datasets nested cross-validation is used to tune the L2 penalty. For the TREC dataset, as for the MRSP dataset, the L2 penalty is tuned on the predefined train split using 10-fold cross-validation, and the accuracy is computed on the test set.\n\nEvaluation Tasks\n-----\nUnsupervised Similarity Evaluation.

We also construct a word co-occurrence network of each text.

However, probably the most surprising result in the field is Zipf's law, which states that if one ranks words by their frequency in a large text, the resulting rank frequency distribution is approximately a power law, for all languages BIBREF0, BIBREF11. These kind of universal results have long piqued the interest of physicists and mathematicians, as well as linguistsBIBREF12, BIBREF13, BIBREF14.

Another interesting characterization of texts is the Heaps-Herdan law, which describes how the vocabulary -that is, the set of different words- grows with the size of a text, the number of which, empirically, has been found to grow as a power of the text size BIBREF18, BIBREF19.

A key aspect of our approach is a novel pre-training scheme that uses millions of synthetic examples to help the model generalize.

Greedy parsers are in the first block, beam-search and dynamic programming parsers in the second block. The third block shows the best result on this benchmark, obtained with constituent parsing with generative re-ranking and conversion to dependencies. Despite being the only non-projective parser tested on a practically projective dataset, our parser achieves the highest score among greedy transition-based models (even above those trained with a dynamic oracle).\n\nResults\n-----\nWe even slightly outperform the arc-swift system of Qi2017, with the same model architecture, implementation and training setup, but based on the projective arc-eager transition-based parser instead. This may be because our system takes into consideration any permissible attachment between the focus word INLINEFORM0 and any word in INLINEFORM1 at each configuration, while their approach is limited by the arc-eager logic: it allows all possible rightward arcs (possibly fewer than our approach as the arc-eager stack usually contains a small number of words), but only one leftward arc is permitted per parser state. It is also worth noting that the arc-swift and NL-Covington parsers have the same worst-case time complexity, ( INLINEFORM2 ), as adding non-local arc transitions to the arc-eager parser increases its complexity from linear to quadratic, but it does not affect the complexity of the Covington algorithm. Thus, it can be argued that this technique is better suited to Covington than to arc-eager parsing.\n\n"

Data structures in Spark are based on resilient distributed datasets (RDD), a read only multi-set of data which can be distributed over a cluster of machines and is fault tolerant. Spark applications run as separate processes on different clusters and are coordinated by the Spark object also referred to as the SparkContext. This element is the main driver of the program which connects with the cluster manager and helps acquire executors on different nodes to allocate resource across applications. Spark is highly scalable, being 100x faster than Hadoop on large datasets, and provides out of the box libraries for both streaming and machine learning.\n\nKryptoOracle ::: Architecture\n-----\nSpark RDD has the innate capability to recover itself because it stores all execution steps in a lineage graph. In case of any faults in the system, Spark redoes all the previous executions from the built DAG and recovers itself to the previous steady state from any fault such as memory overload. Spark RDDs lie in the core of KryptoOracle and therefore make it easier for it to recover from faults. Moreover, faults like memory overload or system crashes may require for the whole system to hard reboot. However, due to the duplicate copies of the RDDs in Apache Hive and the stored previous state of the machine learning model, KryptoOracle can easily recover to the previous steady state.\n\n"

We evaluate the results by using the strict version of precision, recall, and F1-score. For disjoint mentions, all spans also must be strictly correct. To construct the dataset, we used spaCy to split the text into a sequence of tokens when the original datasets do not provide such information.\n\nSentence similarity\n-----\nThe sentence similarity task is to predict similarity scores based on sentence pairs. Following common practice, we evaluate similarity by using Pearson correlation coefficients.\n\nDocument multilabel classification\n-----\nHoC (the Hallmarks of Cancers corpus) consists of 1,580 PubMed abstracts annotated with ten currently known hallmarks of cancer BIBREF27 . Annotation was performed at sentence level by an expert with 15+ years of experience in cancer research. We use 315 ( $\\sim $ 20%) abstracts for testing and the remaining abstracts for training. For the HoC task, we followed the common practice and reported the example-based F1-score on the abstract level BIBREF28 , BIBREF29 .\n\n"

  "title": "Improving Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings by Meeting in the Middle",
  "abstract": "Cross-lingual word embeddings are becoming increasingly important in multilingual NLP. Recently, it has been shown that these embeddings can be effectively learned by aligning two disjoint monolingual vector spaces through linear transformations, using no more than a small bilingual dictionary as supervision. In this work, we propose to apply an additional transformation after the initial alignment step, which moves cross-lingual synonyms towards a middle point between them. By applying this transformation our aim is to obtain a better cross-lingual integration of the vector spaces. In addition, and perhaps surprisingly, the monolingual spaces also improve by this transformation. This is in contrast to the original alignment, which is typically learned such that the structure of the monolingual spaces is preserved. Our experiments confirm that the resulting cross-lingual embeddings outperform state-of-the-art models in both monolingual and cross-lingual evaluation tasks.",
  "question": "What are the tasks that this method has shown improvements?",
  "answer": "bilingual dictionary induction, monolingual and cross-lingual word similarity, and cross-lingual hypernym discovery",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nOur experimental results show that the proposed additional transformation does not only benefit cross-lingual evaluation tasks, but, perhaps surprisingly, also monolingual ones. In particular, we perform an extensive set of experiments on standard benchmarks for bilingual dictionary induction and monolingual and cross-lingual word similarity, as well as on an extrinsic task: cross-lingual hypernym discovery.\n\nExperiments\n-----\nTables 2 and 3 show the monolingual and cross-lingual word similarity results, respectively. For both the monolingual and cross-lingual settings, we can notice that our models generally outperform the corresponding baselines. Moreover, in cases where no improvement is obtained, the differences tend to be minimal, with the exception of RG-65, but this is a very small test set for which larger variations can thus be expected. In contrast, there are a few cases where substantial gains were obtained by using our model. This is most notable for English WordSim and SimLex in the monolingual setting.\n\nExperiments\n-----\nAs can be seen in Table 1 , our refinement method consistently improves over the baselines (i.e., VecMap and MUSE) on all language pairs and metrics. The higher scores indicate that the two monolingual embedding spaces become more tightly integrated because of our additional transformation. It is worth highlighting here the case of English-Finnish, where the gains obtained in $P@5$ and $P@10$ are considerable. This might indicate that our approach is especially useful for morphologically richer languages such as Finnish, where the limitations of the previous bilingual mappings are most apparent.\n\nExperiments\n-----\nThe results listed in Table 4 indicate several trends. First and foremost, in terms of model-wise comparisons, we observe that our proposed alterations of both VecMap and MUSE improve their quality in a consistent manner, across most metrics and data configurations. In Italian our proposed model shows an improvement across all configurations. However, in Spanish VecMap emerges as a highly competitive baseline, with our model only showing an improved performance when training data in this language abounds (in this specific case there is an increase from 17.2 to 19.5 points in the MRR metric). This suggests that the fact that the monolingual spaces are closer in our model is clearly beneficial when hybrid training data is given as input, opening up avenues for future work on weakly-supervised learning. Concerning the other baseline, MUSE, the contribution of our proposed model is consistent for both languages, again becoming more apparent in the Italian split and in a fully cross-lingual setting, where the improvement in MRR is almost 3 points (from 10.6 to 13.3). Finally, it is noteworthy that even in the setting where no training data from the target language is leveraged, all the systems based on cross-lingual embeddings outperform the best unsupervised baseline, which is a very encouraging result with regards to solving tasks for languages on which training data is not easily accessible or not directly available.\n\n"

  "evidence": "Experiments\n-----\nAs a complement of this analysis we show some qualitative results which give us further insights on the transformations of the vector space after our average approximation. In particular, we analyze the reasons behind the higher quality displayed by our bilingual embeddings in monolingual settings. While VecMap and MUSE do not transform the initial monolingual spaces, our model transforms both spaces simultaneously. In this analysis we focus on the source language of our experiments (i.e., English). We found interesting patterns which are learned by our model and help understand these monolingual gains. For example, a recurring pattern is that words in English which are translated to the same word, or to semantically close words, in the target language end up closer together after our transformation. For example, in the case of English-Spanish the following pairs were among the pairs whose similarity increased the most by applying our transformation: cellphone-telephone, movie-film, book-manuscript or rhythm-cadence, which are either translated to the same word in Spanish (i.e., tel\u00e9fono and pel\u00edcula in the first two cases) or are already very close in the Spanish space. More generally, we found that word pairs which move together the most tend to be semantically very similar and belong to the same domain, e.g., car-bicycle, opera-cinema, or snow-ice.\n\n"

  "title": "Cross-lingual Abstract Meaning Representation Parsing",
  "abstract": "Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) annotation efforts have mostly focused on English. In order to train parsers on other languages, we propose a method based on annotation projection, which involves exploiting annotations in a source language and a parallel corpus of the source language and a target language. Using English as the source language, we show promising results for Italian, Spanish, German and Chinese as target languages. Besides evaluating the target parsers on non-gold datasets, we further propose an evaluation method that exploits the English gold annotations and does not require access to gold annotations for the target languages. This is achieved by inverting the projection process: a new English parser is learned from the target language parser and evaluated on the existing English gold standard.",
  "question": "How is annotation projection done when languages have different word order?",
  "answer": "Word alignments are generated for parallel text, and aligned words are assumed to also share AMR node alignments.",
  "evidence": "Method 1: Annotation Projection\n-----\nAMR is not grounded in the input sentence, therefore there is no need to change the AMR annotation when projecting to another language. We think of English labels for the graph nodes as ones from an independent language, which incidentally looks similar to English. However, in order to train state-of-the-art AMR parsers, we also need to project the alignments between AMR nodes and words in the sentence (henceforth called AMR alignments). We use word alignments, similarly to other annotation projection work, to project the AMR alignments to the target languages.\n\nExperiments\n-----\nWord alignments were generated using fast_align BIBREF10 , while AMR alignments were generated with JAMR BIBREF11 . AMREager BIBREF12 was chosen as the pre-existing English AMR parser. AMREager is an open-source AMR parser that needs only minor modifications for re-use with other languages. Our multilingual adaptation of AMREager is available at http://www.github.com/mdtux89/amr-eager-multilingual. It requires tokenization, POS tagging, NER tagging and dependency parsing, which for English, German and Chinese are provided by CoreNLP BIBREF13 . We use Freeling BIBREF14 for Spanish, as CoreNLP does not provide dependency parsing for this language.

  "abstract": "The BERT language model (LM) (Devlin et al., 2019) is surprisingly good at answering cloze-style questions about relational facts. Petroni et al. (2019) take this as evidence that BERT memorizes factual knowledge during pre-training. We take issue with this interpretation and argue that the performance of BERT is partly due to reasoning about (the surface form of) entity names, e.g., guessing that a person with an Italian-sounding name speaks Italian. More specifically, we show that BERT's precision drops dramatically when we filter certain easy-to-guess facts. As a remedy, we propose E-BERT, an extension of BERT that replaces entity mentions with symbolic entity embeddings. E-BERT outperforms both BERT and ERNIE (Zhang et al., 2019) on hard-to-guess queries. We take this as evidence that E-BERT is richer in factual knowledge, and we show two ways of ensembling BERT and E-BERT.",

We evaluate our approach by modeling the types of open-ended questions generated by humans who were attempting to learn about an ambiguous situation in a game.

  "abstract": "We propose a novel text generation task, namely Curiosity-driven Question Generation. We start from the observation that the Question Generation task has traditionally been considered as the dual problem of Question Answering, hence tackling the problem of generating a question given the text that contains its answer. Such questions can be used to evaluate machine reading comprehension. However, in real life, and especially in conversational settings, humans tend to ask questions with the goal of enriching their knowledge and/or clarifying aspects of previously gathered information. We refer to these inquisitive questions as Curiosity-driven: these questions are generated with the goal of obtaining new information (the answer) which is not present in the input text. In this work, we experiment on this new task using a conversational Question Answering (QA) dataset; further, since the majority of QA dataset are not built in a conversational manner, we describe a methodology to derive data for this novel task from non-conversational QA data. We investigate several automated metrics to measure the different properties of Curious Questions, and experiment different approaches on the Curiosity-driven Question Generation task, including model pre-training and reinforcement learning. Finally, we report a qualitative evaluation of the generated outputs.",

These measures evaluate how similar the generated text is to the corresponding reference(s). While they are known to suffer from several shortcomings BIBREF29, BIBREF30, they allow to evaluate specific properties of the developed models. In this work, the metrics detailed below are proposed and we evaluate their quality through a human evaluation in subsection SECREF32.\n\nResults ::: Human Evaluation\n-----\nIn addition to the automatic metrics, we proceeded to a human evaluation. We chose to use the data from our SQuAD-based experiments in order to also to measure the effectiveness of the proposed approach to derive Curiosity-driven QG data from a standard, non-conversational, QA dataset. We randomly sampled 50 samples from the test set. Three professional English speakers were asked to evaluate the questions generated by: humans (i.e. the reference questions), and models trained using pre-training (PT) or (RL), and all combinations of those methods.\n\nResults ::: Human Evaluation\n-----\nBefore submitting the samples for human evaluation, the questions were shuffled.

  "abstract": "We present a novel conversational-context aware end-to-end speech recognizer based on a gated neural network that incorporates conversational-context/word/speech embeddings. Unlike conventional speech recognition models, our model learns longer conversational-context information that spans across sentences and is consequently better at recognizing long conversations. Specifically, we propose to use the text-based external word and/or sentence embeddings (i.e., fastText, BERT) within an end-to-end framework, yielding a significant improvement in word error rate with better conversational-context representation. We evaluated the models on the Switchboard conversational speech corpus and show that our model outperforms standard end-to-end speech recognition models.",
  "question": "How are sentence embeddings incorporated into the speech recognition system?",
  "answer": "BERT generates sentence embeddings that represent words in context. These sentence embeddings are merged into a single conversational-context vector that is used to calculate a gated embedding and is later combined with the output of the decoder h to provide the gated activations for the next hidden layer.",
  "evidence": "External word/sentence embeddings\n-----\nThere exist many word/sentence embeddings which are publicly available. We can broadly classify them into two categories: (1) non-contextual word embeddings, and (2) contextual word embeddings. Non-contextual word embeddings, such as Word2Vec BIBREF1 , GloVe BIBREF39 , fastText BIBREF17 , maps each word independently on the context of the sentence where the word occur in. Although it is easy to use, it assumes that each word represents a single meaning which is not true in real-word. Contextualized word embeddings, sentence embeddings, such as deep contextualized word representations BIBREF20 , BERT BIBREF22 , encode the complex characteristics and meanings of words in various context by jointly training a bidirectional language model. The BERT model proposed a masked language model training approach enabling them to also learn good \u201csentence\u201d representation in order to predict the masked word.\n\nExternal word/sentence embeddings\n-----\nIn this work, we explore both types of embeddings to learn conversational-context embeddings as illustrated in Figure 1 . The first method is to use word embeddings, fastText, to generate 300-dimensional embeddings from 10k-dimensional one-hot vector or distribution over words of each previous word and then merge into a single context vector, $e^k_{context}$ . Since we also consider multiple word/utterance history, we consider two simple ways to merge multiple embeddings (1) mean, and (2) concatenation. The second method is to use sentence embeddings, BERT. It is used to a generate single 786-dimensional sentence embedding from 10k-dimensional one-hot vector or distribution over previous words and then merge into a single context vector with two different merging methods. Since our A2W model uses a restricted vocabulary of 10k as our output units and which is different from the external embedding models, we need to handle out-of-vocabulary words. For fastText, words that are missing in the pretrained embeddings we map them to a random multivariate normal distribution with the mean as the sample mean and variance as the sample variance of the known words. For BERT, we use its provided tokenizer to generates byte pair encodings to handle OOV words.\n\nExternal word/sentence embeddings\n-----\nUsing this approach, we can obtain a more dense, informative, fixed-length vectors to encode conversational-context information, $e^k_{context}$ to be used in next $k$ -th utterance prediction.\n\nContextual gating\n-----\nWe use contextual gating mechanism in our decoder network to combine the conversational-context embeddings with speech and word embeddings effectively. Our gating is contextual in the sense that multiple embeddings compute a gate value that is dependent on the context of multiple utterances that occur in a conversation. Using these contextual gates can be beneficial to decide how to weigh the different embeddings, conversational-context, word and speech embeddings. Rather than merely concatenating conversational-context embeddings BIBREF6 , contextual gating can achieve more improvement because its increased representational power using multiplicative interactions.\n\n"

For our approach, three discourse dictionaries were created: first, we created a dictionary by retrieving possibly racist and more neutral terms from the training data, and then augmenting these with more general words to remove some bias. A second dictionary was created through automatic expansion using a \\texttt{word2vec} model trained on a large corpus of general Dutch text. Finally, a third dictionary was created by manually filtering out incorrect expansions. We trained multiple Support Vector Machines, using the distribution of words over the different categories in the dictionaries as features. The best-performing model used the manually cleaned dictionary and obtained an F-score of 0.46 for the racist class on a test set consisting of unseen Dutch comments, retrieved from the same sites used for the training set. The automated expansion of the dictionary only slightly boosted the model's performance, and this increase in performance was not statistically significant. The fact that the coverage of the expanded dictionaries did increase indicates that the words that were automatically added did occur in the corpus, but were not able to meaningfully impact performance. The dictionaries, code, and the procedure for requesting the corpus are available at: https://github.com/clips/hades",
  "question": "how did they ask if a tweet was racist?",
  "answer": "if it includes  negative utterances, negative generalizations and insults concerning ethnicity, nationality, religion and culture.",
  "evidence": "Related Research\n-----\nThe classification of racist insults presents us with the problem of giving an adequate definition of racism. More so than in other domains, judging whether an utterance is an act of racism is highly personal and does not easily fit a simple definition. The Belgian anti-racist law forbids discrimination, violence and crime based on physical qualities (like skin color), nationality or ethnicity, but does not mention textual insults based on these qualities. Hence, this definition is not adequate for our purposes, since it does not include the racist utterances one would find on social media; few utterances that people might perceive as racist are actually punishable by law, as only utterances which explicitly encourage the use of violence are illegal. For this reason, we use a common sense definition of racist language, including all negative utterances, negative generalizations and insults concerning ethnicity, nationality, religion and culture. In this, we follow paolo2015racist, bonilla2002linguistics and razavi2010offensive, who show that racism is no longer strictly limited to physical or ethnic qualities, but can also include social and cultural aspects.\n\n"

  "title": "Detecting Fake News with Capsule Neural Networks",
  "abstract": "Fake news is dramatically increased in social media in recent years. This has prompted the need for effective fake news detection algorithms. Capsule neural networks have been successful in computer vision and are receiving attention for use in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper aims to use capsule neural networks in the fake news detection task. We use different embedding models for news items of different lengths. Static word embedding is used for short news items, whereas non-static word embeddings that allow incremental up-training and updating in the training phase are used for medium length or large news statements. Moreover, we apply different levels of n-grams for feature extraction. Our proposed architectures are evaluated on two recent well-known datasets in the field, namely ISOT and LIAR. The results show encouraging performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 7.8% on ISOT and 3.1% on the validation set, and 1% on the test set of the LIAR dataset.",

For example, de Stentor is estimated to reach 275K readers each day on its official website. Deciding the audience leaning from 55 samples was subject to sampling bias. Besides, the scores differ very little between publishers. None of the publishers had an absolute score higher than 1, meaning that even the most partisan publisher was only slightly partisan. Deciding which publishers we consider as partisan and which not is thus not very reliable.\n\nLimitations\n-----\nThe article-level annotation task was not as well-defined as on a crowdsourcing platform. We included the questions as part of an existing survey and didn't want to create much burden to the annotators. Therefore, we did not provide long descriptive text that explained how a person should annotate an article. We thus run under the risk of annotator bias.

However, most KGs are far from complete and are growing at a rapid pace. To address these problems, Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has been proposed to improve KGs by filling in its missing connections. Unlike existing methods which hold a closed-world assumption, i.e., where KGs are fixed and new entities cannot be easily added, in the present work we relax this assumption and propose a new open-world KGC task. As a first attempt to solve this task we introduce an open-world KGC model called ConMask. This model learns embeddings of the entity's name and parts of its text-description to connect unseen entities to the KG. To mitigate the presence of noisy text descriptions, ConMask uses a relationship-dependent content masking to extract relevant snippets and then trains a fully convolutional neural network to fuse the extracted snippets with entities in the KG. Experiments on large data sets, both old and new, show that ConMask performs well in the open-world KGC task and even outperforms existing KGC models on the standard closed-world KGC task.",

A research challenge now is the search for architectures that best support the capture, preparation and provision of src and mt information and its integration with pe decisions. In this paper we present a new multi-source APE model, called transference. Unlike previous approaches, it (i) uses a transformer encoder block for src, (ii) followed by a decoder block, but without masking for self-attention on mt, which effectively acts as second encoder combining src -> mt, and (iii) feeds this representation into a final decoder block generating pe. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by 1 BLEU point on the WMT 2016, 2017, and 2018 English--German APE shared tasks (PBSMT and NMT).

  "abstract": "Translations capture important information about languages that can be used as implicit supervision in learning linguistic properties and semantic representations. In an information-centric view, translated texts may be considered as semantic mirrors of the original text and the significant variations that we can observe across various languages can be used to disambiguate a given expression using the linguistic signal that is grounded in translation. Parallel corpora consisting of massive amounts of human translations with a large linguistic variation can be applied to increase abstractions and we propose the use of highly multilingual machine translation models to find language-independent meaning representations. Our initial experiments show that neural machine translation models can indeed learn in such a setup and we can show that the learning algorithm picks up information about the relation between languages in order to optimize transfer leaning with shared parameters. The model creates a continuous language space that represents relationships in terms of geometric distances, which we can visualize to illustrate how languages cluster according to language families and groups.

In our setup, we will follow the main idea proposed by Johnson et al. BIBREF22 . The authors of that paper suggest a simple addition by means of a language flag on the source language side (see Figure 2 ) to indicate the target language that needs to be produced by the decoder. This flag will be mapped on a dense vector representation and can be used to trigger the generation of the selected language. The authors of the paper argue that the model enables transfer learning and supports the translation between languages that are not explicitly available in training. This ability gives a hint of some kind of vector-based \u201cinterlingua\u201d, which is precisely what we are looking for.

  "abstract": "This article describes the constitution process of the first morpho-syntactically annotated Tunisian Arabish Corpus (TArC). Arabish, also known as Arabizi, is a spontaneous coding of Arabic dialects in Latin characters and arithmographs (numbers used as letters). This code-system was developed by Arabic-speaking users of social media in order to facilitate the writing in the Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) and text messaging informal frameworks. There is variety in the realization of Arabish amongst dialects, and each Arabish code-system is under-resourced, in the same way as most of the Arabic dialects. In the last few years, the focus on Arabic dialects in the NLP field has considerably increased. Taking this into consideration, TArC will be a useful support for different types of analyses, computational and linguistic, as well as for NLP tools training. In this article we will describe preliminary work on the TArC semi-automatic construction process and some of the first analyses we developed on TArC. In addition, in order to provide a complete overview of the challenges faced during the building process, we will present the main Tunisian dialect characteristics and their encoding in Tunisian Arabish.",

  "evidence": "Incremental and Semi-Automatic Transcription\n-----\nIn order to make the corpus collection easier and faster, we adopted a semi-automatic procedure based on sequential neural models BIBREF19, BIBREF20. Since transcribing Arabish into Arabic is by far the most important information to study the Arabish code-system, the semi-automatic procedure concerns only transcription from Arabish to Arabic script. In order to proceed, we used the first group of (roughly) 6,000 manually transcribed tokens as training and test data sets in a 10-fold cross validation setting with 9-1 proportions for training and test, respectively. As we explained in the previous section, French tokens were removed from the data. More precisely, whole sentences containing non-transcribable French tokens (code-switching) were removed from the data. Since at this level there is no way for predicting when a French word can be transcribed into Arabic and when it has to be left unchanged, French tokens create some noise for an automatic, probabilistic model. After removing sentences with French tokens, the data reduced to roughly 5,000 tokens. We chose this amount of tokens for annotation blocks in our incremental annotation procedure.\n\nIncremental and Semi-Automatic Transcription\n-----\nWe note that by combining sentence, paragraph and token index in the corpus, whole sentences can be reconstructed. However, from 5,000 tokens roughly 300 sentences could be reconstructed, which are far too few to be used for training a neural model. Instead, since tokens are transcribed at morpheme level, we split Arabish tokens into characters, and Arabic tokens into morphemes, and we treated each token itself as a sequence. Our model learns thus to map Arabish characters into Arabic morphemes.\n\nIncremental and Semi-Automatic Transcription\n-----\nThe 10-fold cross validation with this setting gave a token-level accuracy of roughly 71%. This result is not satisfactory on an absolute scale, however it is more than encouraging taking into account the small size of our data. This result means that less than 3 tokens, on average, out of 10, must be corrected to increase the size of our corpus. With this model we automatically transcribed into Arabic morphemes, roughly, 5,000 additional tokens, corresponding to the second annotation block. This can be manually annotated in at least 7,5 days, but thanks to the automatic annotation accuracy, it was manually corrected into 3 days. The accuracy of the model on the annotation of the second block was roughly 70%, which corresponds to the accuracy on the test set. The manually-corrected additional tokens were added to the training data of our neural model, and a new block was automatically annotated and manually corrected. Both accuracy on the test set and on the annotation block remained at around 70%. This is because the block added to the training data was significantly different from the previous and from the third. Adding the third block to the training data and annotating a fourth block with the new trained model gave in contrast an accuracy of roughly 80%. This incremental, semi-automatic transcription procedure is in progress for the remaining blocks, but it is clear that it will make the corpus annotation increasingly easier and faster as the amount of training data will grow up.\n\n"

  "title": "Question Answering and Question Generation as Dual Tasks",
  "abstract": "We study the problem of joint question answering (QA) and question generation (QG) in this paper. Our intuition is that QA and QG have intrinsic connections and these two tasks could improve each other. On one side, the QA model judges whether the generated question of a QG model is relevant to the answer. On the other side, the QG model provides the probability of generating a question given the answer, which is a useful evidence that in turn facilitates QA. In this paper we regard QA and QG as dual tasks. We propose a training framework that trains the models of QA and QG simultaneously, and explicitly leverages their probabilistic correlation to guide the training process of both models. We implement a QG model based on sequence-to-sequence learning, and a QA model based on recurrent neural network. As all the components of the QA and QG models are differentiable, all the parameters involved in these two models could be conventionally learned with back propagation. We conduct experiments on three datasets. Empirical results show that our training framework improves both QA and QG tasks. The improved QA model performs comparably with strong baseline approaches on all three datasets.",
  "question": "What does \"explicitly leverages their probabilistic correlation to guide the training process of both models\" mean?",
  "answer": "The framework jointly learns parametrized QA and QG models subject to the constraint in equation 2. In more detail, they minimize QA and QG loss functions, with a third dual loss for regularization.",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nThe conditional distribution $P(q|a)$ is exactly the QG model, and the conditional distribution $P(a|q)$ is closely related to the QA model. Existing studies typically learn the QA model and the QG model separately by minimizing their own loss functions, while ignoring the probabilistic correlation between them.\n\nAlgorithm Description\n-----\nWe describe the proposed algorithm in this subsection. Overall, the framework includes three components, namely a QA model, a QG model and a regularization term that reflects the duality of QA and QG. Accordingly, the training objective of our framework includes three parts, which is described in Algorithm 1.\n\nAlgorithm Description\n-----\nThe QA specific objective aims to minimize the loss function $l_{qa}(f_{qa}(a,q;\\theta _{qa}), label)$ , where $label$ is 0 or 1 that indicates whether $a$ is the correct answer of $q$ or not. Since the goal of a QA model is to predict whether a question-answer pair is correct or not, it is necessary to use negative QA pairs whose labels are zero. The details about the QA model will be presented in the next section.\n\nAlgorithm Description\n-----\nwhere $a$ is the correct answer of $q$ . The negative QA pairs are not necessary because the goal of a QG model is to generate the correct question for an answer. The QG model will be described in the following section.\n\n"

  "title": "Information-Theoretic Probing for Linguistic Structure",
  "abstract": "The success of neural networks on a diverse set of NLP tasks has led researchers to question how much do these networks actually know about natural language. Probes are a natural way of assessing this. When probing, a researcher chooses a linguistic task and trains a supervised model to predict annotation in that linguistic task from the network's learned representations. If the probe does well, the researcher may conclude that the representations encode knowledge related to the task. A commonly held belief is that using simpler models as probes is better; the logic is that such models will identify linguistic structure, but not learn the task itself. We propose an information-theoretic formalization of probing as estimating mutual information that contradicts this received wisdom: one should always select the highest performing probe one can, even if it is more complex, since it will result in a tighter estimate. The empirical portion of our paper focuses on obtaining tight estimates for how much information BERT knows about parts of speech in a set of five typologically diverse languages that are often underrepresented in parsing research, plus English, totaling six languages. We find BERT accounts for only at most 5% more information than traditional, type-based word embeddings.",
  "question": "Was any variation in results observed based on language typology?",
  "answer": "It is observed some variability - but not significant. Bert does not seem to gain much more syntax information than with type level information.",
  "evidence": "Conclusion\n-----\nOn another note, we apply our formalization to evaluate multilingual $\\textsc {bert} $'s syntax knowledge on a set of six typologically diverse languages. Although it does encode a large amount of information about syntax (more than $81\\%$ in all languages), it only encodes at most $5\\%$ more information than some trivial baseline knowledge (a type-level representation). This indicates that the task of POS labeling (word-level POS tagging) is not an ideal task for contemplating the syntactic understanding of contextual word embeddings.\n\nExperiments ::: Results\n-----\nWe know $\\textsc {bert} $ can generate text in many languages, here we assess how much does it actually know about syntax in those languages. And how much more does it know than simple type-level baselines. tab:results-full presents this results, showing how much information $\\textsc {bert} $, fastText and onehot embeddings encode about POS tagging. We see that\u2014in all analysed languages\u2014type level embeddings can already capture most of the uncertainty in POS tagging. We also see that BERT only shares a small amount of extra information with the task, having small (or even negative) gains in all languages.\n\nExperiments ::: Results\n-----\nFinally, when put into perspective, multilingual $\\textsc {bert} $'s representations do not seem to encode much more information about syntax than a trivial baseline. $\\textsc {bert} $ only improves upon fastText in three of the six analysed languages\u2014and even in those, it encodes at most (in English) $5\\%$ additional information.\n\n"

  "title": "Translation of Patent Sentences with a Large Vocabulary of Technical Terms Using Neural Machine Translation",
  "abstract": "Neural machine translation (NMT), a new approach to machine translation, has achieved promising results comparable to those of traditional approaches such as statistical machine translation (SMT). Despite its recent success, NMT cannot handle a larger vocabulary because training complexity and decoding complexity proportionally increase with the number of target words. This problem becomes even more serious when translating patent documents, which contain many technical terms that are observed infrequently. In NMTs, words that are out of vocabulary are represented by a single unknown token. In this paper, we propose a method that enables NMT to translate patent sentences comprising a large vocabulary of technical terms. We train an NMT system on bilingual data wherein technical terms are replaced with technical term tokens; this allows it to translate most of the source sentences except technical terms. Further, we use it as a decoder to translate source sentences with technical term tokens and replace the tokens with technical term translations using SMT. We also use it to rerank the 1,000-best SMT translations on the basis of the average of the SMT score and that of the NMT rescoring of the translated sentences with technical term tokens. Our experiments on Japanese-Chinese patent sentences show that the proposed NMT system achieves a substantial improvement of up to 3.1 BLEU points and 2.3 RIBES points over traditional SMT systems and an improvement of approximately 0.6 BLEU points and 0.8 RIBES points over an equivalent NMT system without our proposed technique.",
  "question": "Can the approach be generalized to other technical domains as well? ",
  "answer": "There is no reason to think that this approach wouldn't also be successful for other technical domains. Technical terms are replaced with tokens, therefore so as long as there is a corresponding process for identifying and replacing technical terms in the new domain this approach could be viable.",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nIn this paper, we propose a method that enables NMT to translate patent sentences with a large vocabulary of technical terms. We use an NMT model similar to that used by Sutskever et al. Sutskever14, which uses a deep long short-term memories (LSTM) BIBREF7 to encode the input sentence and a separate deep LSTM to output the translation. We train the NMT model on a bilingual corpus in which the technical terms are replaced with technical term tokens; this allows it to translate most of the source sentences except technical terms. Similar to Sutskever et al. Sutskever14, we use it as a decoder to translate source sentences with technical term tokens and replace the tokens with technical term translations using statistical machine translation (SMT). We also use it to rerank the 1,000-best SMT translations on the basis of the average of the SMT and NMT scores of the translated sentences that have been rescored with the technical term tokens. Our experiments on Japanese-Chinese patent sentences show that our proposed NMT system achieves a substantial improvement of up to 3.1 BLEU points and 2.3 RIBES points over a traditional SMT system and an improvement of approximately 0.6 BLEU points and 0.8 RIBES points over an equivalent NMT system without our proposed technique.\n\nNeural Machine Translation (NMT)\n-----\nOne important difference between our NMT model and the one used by Sutskever et al. Sutskever14 is that we added an attention mechanism. Recently, Bahdanau et al. Bahdanau15 proposed an attention mechanism, a form of random access memory, to help NMT cope with long input sequences. Luong et al. Luong15b proposed an attention mechanism for different scoring functions in order to compare the source and target hidden states as well as different strategies for placing the attention. In this paper, we utilize the attention mechanism proposed by Bahdanau et al. Bahdanau15, wherein each output target word is predicted on the basis of not only a recurrent hidden state and the previously predicted word but also a context vector computed as the weighted sum of the hidden states.\n\nNMT Training after Replacing Technical Term Pairs with Tokens\n-----\nFor the Japanese technical terms whose Chinese translations are not included in the results of Step UID11 , we then use an approach based on SMT word alignment. Given a parallel sentence pair $\\langle S_J, S_C\\rangle $ containing a Japanese technical term $t_J$ , a sequence of Chinese words is selected using SMT word alignment, and we use the Chinese translation $t_C$ for the Japanese technical term $t_J$ .\n\nNMT Decoding and SMT Technical Term Translation\n-----\nFigure 3 illustrates the procedure for producing Chinese translations via decoding the Japanese sentence using the method proposed in this paper. In the step 1 of Figure 3 , when given an input Japanese sentence, we first automatically extract the technical terms and replace them with the technical term tokens \u201c $TT_{i}$ \u201d ( $i=1,2,\\ldots $ ). Consequently, we have an input sentence in which the technical term tokens \u201c $TT_{i}$ \u201d ( $i=1,2,\\ldots $ ) represent the positions of the technical terms and a list of extracted Japanese technical terms. Next, as shown in the step 2-N of Figure 3 , the source Japanese sentence with technical term tokens is translated using the NMT model trained according to the procedure described in Section \"NMT Training after Replacing Technical Term Pairs with Tokens\" , whereas the extracted Japanese technical terms are translated using an SMT phrase translation table in the step 2-S of Figure 3 . Finally, in the step 3, we replace the technical term tokens \u201c $TT_{i}$ \u201d ( $i=1,2,\\ldots $ ) of the sentence translation with SMT the technical term translations.\n\n"

All models after the initialization step are implemented as convolutional seq2seq architectures using Fairseq BIBREF20. Artificial data generation uses top-15 sampling, with a minimum length of 16 for full text and a maximum length of 12 for summaries. rouge scores are obtained with an output vocabulary of size 15K and a beam search of size 5 to match BIBREF11.\n\n"

This paper provides a classical, supervised, statistical learning framework for prediction from text, using topic models as a data reduction method and the topics themselves as predictors, alongside typical statistical tools for predictive modelling. We apply this framework in a Social Sciences context (applied animal behaviour) as well as a Humanities context (narrative analysis) as examples of this framework.

The area under the curve (AUC) (between 0 and 1) is a numerical measure, where the higher the AUC is, the better the model performs.\n\nWord count model\n-----\nWe cross-validate our model by first randomly splitting the corpus into a training set (95% of the corpus) and test set (5% of the corpus).

  "abstract": "Competency Questions (CQs) are natural language questions outlining and constraining the scope of knowledge represented by an ontology. Despite that CQs are a part of several ontology engineering methodologies, we have observed that the actual publication of CQs for the available ontologies is very limited and even scarcer is the publication of their respective formalisations in terms of, e.g., SPARQL queries. This paper aims to contribute to addressing the engineering shortcomings of using CQs in ontology development, to facilitate wider use of CQs. In order to understand the relation between CQs and the queries over the ontology to test the CQs on an ontology, we gather, analyse, and publicly release a set of 234 CQs and their translations to SPARQL-OWL for several ontologies in different domains developed by different groups. We analysed the CQs in two principal ways. The first stage focused on a linguistic analysis of the natural language text itself, i.e., a lexico-syntactic analysis without any presuppositions of ontology elements, and a subsequent step of semantic analysis in order to find patterns. This increased diversity of CQ sources resulted in a 5-fold increase of hitherto published patterns, to 106 distinct CQ patterns, which have a limited subset of few patterns shared across the CQ sets from the different ontologies. Next, we analysed the relation between the found CQ patterns and the 46 SPARQL-OWL query signatures, which revealed that one CQ pattern may be realised by more than one SPARQL-OWL query signature, and vice versa.

  "question": "What's the method used here?",
  "answer": "Two neural networks: an extractor based on an encoder (BERT) and a decoder (LSTM Pointer Network BIBREF22) and an abstractor identical to the one proposed in BIBREF8.",
  "evidence": "Model\n-----\nOur model consists of two neural network modules, i.e. an extractor and abstractor. The extractor encodes a source document and chooses sentences from the document, and then the abstractor paraphrases the summary candidates. Formally, a single document consists of $n$ sentences $D=\\lbrace s_1,s_2,\\cdots ,s_n\\rbrace $. We denote $i$-th sentence as $s_i=\\lbrace w_{i1},w_{i2},\\cdots ,w_{im}\\rbrace $ where $w_{ij}$ is the $j$-th word in $s_i$. The extractor learns to pick out a subset of $D$ denoted as $\\hat{D}=\\lbrace \\hat{s}_1,\\hat{s}_2,\\cdots ,\\hat{s}_k|\\hat{s}_i\\in D\\rbrace $ where $k$ sentences are selected. The abstractor rewrites each of the selected sentences to form a summary $S=\\lbrace f(\\hat{s}_1),f(\\hat{s}_2),\\cdots ,f(\\hat{s}_k)\\rbrace $, where $f$ is an abstracting function. And a gold summary consists of $l$ sentences $A=\\lbrace a_1,a_2,\\cdots ,a_l\\rbrace $.\n\nModel ::: Extractor Network\n-----\nThe extractor is based on the encoder-decoder framework. We adapt BERT for the encoder to exploit contextualized representations from pre-trained transformers. BERT as the encoder maps the input sequence $D$ to sentence representation vectors $H=\\lbrace h_1,h_2,\\cdots ,h_n\\rbrace $, where $h_i$ is for the $i$-th sentence in the document. Then, the decoder utilizes $H$ to extract $\\hat{D}$ from $D$.\n\nModel ::: Extractor Network ::: Sentence Selection\n-----\nWe use LSTM Pointer Network BIBREF22 as the decoder to select the extracted sentences based on the above sentence representations. The decoder extracts sentences recurrently, producing a distribution over all of the remaining sentence representations excluding those already selected. Since we use the sequential model which selects one sentence at a time step, our decoder can consider the previously selected sentences. This property is needed to avoid selecting sentences that have overlapping information with the sentences extracted already.\n\nModel ::: Abstractor Network\n-----\nThe abstractor network approximates $f$, which compresses and paraphrases an extracted document sentence to a concise summary sentence. We use the standard attention based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model BIBREF23, BIBREF24 with the copying mechanism BIBREF25 for handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Our abstractor is practically identical to the one proposed in BIBREF8.\n\n"

  "title": "Contextual Out-of-Domain Utterance Handling With Counterfeit Data Augmentation",
  "abstract": "Neural dialog models often lack robustness to anomalous user input and produce inappropriate responses which leads to frustrating user experience. Although there are a set of prior approaches to out-of-domain (OOD) utterance detection, they share a few restrictions: they rely on OOD data or multiple sub-domains, and their OOD detection is context-independent which leads to suboptimal performance in a dialog. The goal of this paper is to propose a novel OOD detection method that does not require OOD data by utilizing counterfeit OOD turns in the context of a dialog. For the sake of fostering further research, we also release new dialog datasets which are 3 publicly available dialog corpora augmented with OOD turns in a controllable way. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art dialog models equipped with a conventional OOD detection mechanism by a large margin in the presence of OOD utterances.",
  "question": "By how much does their method outperform state-of-the-art OOD detection?",
  "answer": "AE-HCN outperforms by 17%, AE-HCN-CNN outperforms by 20% on average",
  "evidence": "EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND EVALUATION\n-----\nThe result is shown in Table TABREF23 . Since there are multiple actions that are appropriate for a given dialog context, we use per-utterance Precision@K as performance metric. We also report f1-score for OOD detection to measure the balance between precision and recall. The performances of HCN on Test-OOD are about 15 points down on average from those on Test, showing the detrimental impact of OOD utterances to such models only trained on in-domain training data. AE-HCN(-CNN) outperforms HCN on Test-OOD by a large margin about 17(20) points on average while keeping the minimum performance trade-off compared to Test. Interestingly, AE-HCN-CNN has even better performance than HCN on Test, indicating that, with the CNN encoder, counterfeit OOD augmentation acts as an effective regularization. In contrast, AE-HCN-Indep failed to robustly detect OOD utterances, resulting in much lower numbers for both metrics on Test-OOD as well as hurting the performance on Test. This result indicates two crucial points: 1) the inherent difficulty of finding an appropriate threshold value without actually seeing OOD data; 2) the limitation of the models which do not consider context. For the first point, Figure FIGREF24 plots histograms of reconstruction scores for IND and OOD utterances of bAbI6 Test-OOD. If OOD utterances had been known a priori, the threshold should have been set to a much higher value than the maximum reconstruction score of IND training data (6.16 in this case).\n\n"

  "title": "Efficient keyword spotting using dilated convolutions and gating",
  "abstract": "We explore the application of end-to-end stateless temporal modeling to small-footprint keyword spotting as opposed to recurrent networks that model long-term temporal dependencies using internal states. We propose a model inspired by the recent success of dilated convolutions in sequence modeling applications, allowing to train deeper architectures in resource-constrained configurations. Gated activations and residual connections are also added, following a similar configuration to WaveNet. In addition, we apply a custom target labeling that back-propagates loss from specific frames of interest, therefore yielding higher accuracy and only requiring to detect the end of the keyword. Our experimental results show that our model outperforms a max-pooling loss trained recurrent neural network using LSTM cells, with a significant decrease in false rejection rate. The underlying dataset -\"Hey Snips\"utterances recorded by over 2.2K different speakers - has been made publicly available to establish an open reference for wake-word detection.",
  "question": "What are dilated convolutions?",
  "answer": "Similar to standard convolutional networks but instead they skip some input values effectively operating on a broader scale.",
  "evidence": "Introduction\n-----\nIn this work we focus on end-to-end stateless temporal modeling which can take advantage of a large context while limiting computation and avoiding saturation issues. By end-to-end model, we mean a straight-forward model with a binary target that does not require a precise phoneme alignment beforehand. We explore an architecture based on a stack of dilated convolution layers, effectively operating on a broader scale than with standard convolutions while limiting model size. We further improve our solution with gated activations and residual skip-connections, inspired by the WaveNet style architecture explored previously for text-to-speech applications BIBREF10 and voice activity detection BIBREF9 , but never applied to KWS to our knowledge. In BIBREF11 , the authors explore Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) for KWS. ResNets differ from WaveNet models in that they do not leverage skip-connections and gating, and apply convolution kernels in the frequency domain, drastically increasing the computational cost.\n\n"

  "title": "Impact of Sentiment Detection to Recognize Toxic and Subversive Online Comments",
  "abstract": "The presence of toxic content has become a major problem for many online communities. Moderators try to limit this problem by implementing more and more refined comment filters, but toxic users are constantly finding new ways to circumvent them. Our hypothesis is that while modifying toxic content and keywords to fool filters can be easy, hiding sentiment is harder. In this paper, we explore various aspects of sentiment detection and their correlation to toxicity, and use our results to implement a toxicity detection tool. We then test how adding the sentiment information helps detect toxicity in three different real-world datasets, and incorporate subversion to these datasets to simulate a user trying to circumvent the system. Our results show sentiment information has a positive impact on toxicity detection against a subversive user.",
  "question": "what datasets did the authors use?",
  "answer": "Kaggle\nSubversive Kaggle\nWikipedia\nSubversive Wikipedia\nReddit\nSubversive Reddit ",
  "evidence": "Subversive Toxicity Detection\n-----\nWe trained and tested our neural network with and without sentiment information, with and without subversion, and with each corpus three times to mitigate the randomness in training. In every experiment, we used a random 70% of messages in the corpus as training data, another 20% as validation data, and the final 10% as testing data. The average results of the three tests are given in Table TABREF40 . It can be seen that sentiment information helps improve toxicity detection in all cases. The improvement is smaller when the text is clean. However, the introduction of subversion leads to an important drop in the accuracy of toxicity detection in the network that uses the text alone, and the inclusion of sentiment information gives an important improvement in that case. Comparing the different corpora, it can be seen that the improvement is smallest in the Reddit dataset experiment, which is expected since it is also the dataset in which toxicity and sentiment had the weakest correlation in Table TABREF37 .\n\n"

  "abstract": "We propose a simple yet robust stochastic answer network (SAN) that simulates multi-step reasoning in machine reading comprehension. Compared to previous work such as ReasoNet which used reinforcement learning to determine the number of steps, the unique feature is the use of a kind of stochastic prediction dropout on the answer module (final layer) of the neural network during the training.

We expect significant improvements if we add this to SAN in future work.\n\nResults\n-----\nThe main experimental question we would like to answer is whether the stochastic dropout and averaging in the answer module is an effective technique for multi-step reasoning. To do so, we fixed all lower layers and compared different architectures for the answer module:\n\n"

  "abstract": "Social norms are shared rules that govern and facilitate social interaction. Violating such social norms via teasing and insults may serve to upend power imbalances or, on the contrary reinforce solidarity and rapport in conversation, rapport which is highly situated and context-dependent. In this work, we investigate the task of automatically identifying the phenomena of social norm violation in discourse. Towards this goal, we leverage the power of recurrent neural networks and multimodal information present in the interaction, and propose a predictive model to recognize social norm violation. Using long-term temporal and contextual information, our model achieves an F1 score of 0.705. Implications of our work regarding developing a social-aware agent are discussed.",
  "question": "Does this paper propose a new task that others can try to improve performance on?",
  "answer": "No, there has been previous work on recognizing social norm violation.",
  "evidence": "Introduction and Related Work\n-----\nInteresting prior work on quantifying social norm violation has taken a heavily data-driven focus BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 . For instance, BIBREF8 trained a series of bigram language models to quantify the violation of social norms in users' posts on an online community by leveraging cross-entropy value, or the deviation of word sequences predicted by the language model and their usage by the user. However, their models were trained on written-language instead of natural face-face dialog corpus. Another kind of social norm violation was examined by BIBREF10 , who developed a classifier to identify specific types of sarcasm in tweets. They utilized a bootstrapping algorithm to automatically extract lists of positive sentiment phrases and negative situation phrases from given sarcastic tweets, which were in turn leveraged to recognize sarcasm in an SVM classifier. However, no contextual information was considered in this work. BIBREF11 understood the nature of social norm violation in dialog by correlating it with associated observable verbal, vocal and visual cues. By leveraging their findings and statistical machine learning techniques, they built a computational model for automatic recognition. While they preserved short-term temporal contextual information in the model, this study avoided dealing with sparsity of the social norm violation phenomena by under-sampling the negative-class instances to make a balanced dataset.\n\n"

For training data, 3 million webpages from this corpus were processed with a CCG parser to produce logical forms BIBREF10 . This produced 2.1m predicate instances involving 142k entity pairs and 184k entities.

For a final evaluation, we generated another, similar test set from a different held out section of ClueWeb, in the same fashion as done by Krishnamurthy and Mitchell.

Our model ConvKB advances state-of-the-art models by employing a convolutional neural network, so that it can capture global relationships and transitional characteristics between entities and relations in knowledge bases. In ConvKB, each triple (head entity, relation, tail entity) is represented as a 3-column matrix where each column vector represents a triple element. This 3-column matrix is then fed to a convolution layer where multiple filters are operated on the matrix to generate different feature maps. These feature maps are then concatenated into a single feature vector representing the input triple. The feature vector is multiplied with a weight vector via a dot product to return a score. This score is then used to predict whether the triple is valid or not. Experiments show that ConvKB achieves better link prediction performance than previous state-of-the-art embedding models on two benchmark datasets WN18RR and FB15k-237.",
